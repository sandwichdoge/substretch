2
00:01:04,686 --> 00:01:10,257
Leaving this to come see you.

3
00:01:10,391 --> 00:01:12,861
And I can't wait.

4
00:01:32,748 --> 00:01:33,882
Whew.

5
00:01:43,557 --> 00:01:45,060
Taxi! Over here.

6
00:01:52,901 --> 00:01:53,869
Taxi!

7
00:01:54,002 --> 00:01:56,938
Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry.

8
00:01:57,072 --> 00:02:00,274
Excuse me. Excuse me.

9
00:02:20,394 --> 00:02:21,797
- Gilpin!
- Ahh!

10
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:24,699
You still on the toothpaste?
Are you on your phone?

11
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:27,568
I'm just... I'm going home
for the holidays tonight, so...

12
00:02:27,702 --> 00:02:29,171
Does it look like
tonight to you?

13
00:02:29,303 --> 00:02:31,273
Because to me,
it looks like today.

14
00:02:31,405 --> 00:02:34,408
- Finish the toothpaste.
- Okay. Sorry.

15
00:03:44,713 --> 00:03:46,915
Dad, we're home!

16
00:03:47,048 --> 00:03:49,217
I'm in the kitchen!

17
00:03:49,351 --> 00:03:51,385
Jan, Spencer!

18
00:03:51,518 --> 00:03:53,088
In the kitchen!

19
00:03:55,357 --> 00:03:57,692
Dad, are you on a ladder?

20
00:03:57,826 --> 00:03:59,060
- What are you doing?
- Grandpa.

21
00:03:59,194 --> 00:04:00,527
- What's it look like?
- Get down.

22
00:04:00,662 --> 00:04:02,030
I'm changing your light bulb.

23
00:04:02,163 --> 00:04:04,232
I leave for 10 minutes,
you're climbing ladders?

24
00:04:04,366 --> 00:04:06,067
Don't think
you should be doing that.

25
00:04:06,201 --> 00:04:07,936
You think I can't
change a light bulb?

26
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:10,537
- Okay.
- There.

27
00:04:10,672 --> 00:04:12,674
Ugh! No, no, no.

28
00:04:12,807 --> 00:04:14,508
- I got it. I'm fine.
- Okay.

29
00:04:14,642 --> 00:04:16,543
Hey, kiddo!

30
00:04:16,678 --> 00:04:19,714
Hey, how's New York City?

31
00:04:19,848 --> 00:04:22,583
- It's great.
- How's school?

32
00:04:22,717 --> 00:04:24,753
It's okay. How you doing?

33
00:04:24,886 --> 00:04:27,389
I'm terrific. I don't
even know what I'm doing here.

34
00:04:27,521 --> 00:04:29,090
You're recovering
from hip surgery.

35
00:04:29,224 --> 00:04:31,592
Meh! I'll be out
of here in no time.

36
00:04:31,726 --> 00:04:32,761
It's not a prison.

37
00:04:32,894 --> 00:04:34,528
I wanna get back
to my apartment.

38
00:04:34,663 --> 00:04:37,699
- Is that so terrible?
- Your apartment? It's terrible.

39
00:04:37,832 --> 00:04:39,301
Is it really cold in here?

40
00:04:39,433 --> 00:04:41,269
The downstairs heater
isn't working.

41
00:04:41,403 --> 00:04:44,706
- The guy's coming in the morning.
- It's like a goddamn icebox.

42
00:04:45,874 --> 00:04:47,108
Did you ever call Milo?

43
00:04:47,242 --> 00:04:48,542
What? No.

44
00:04:48,677 --> 00:04:51,112
Dad. He's called five times.
Just call him back.

45
00:04:51,246 --> 00:04:53,782
I'm not calling him back.
I don't wanna talk to him.

46
00:04:55,216 --> 00:04:57,919
Come on, I'll help you
with your bags.

47
00:04:59,721 --> 00:05:01,656
Oh, you're staying in here.

48
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:03,658
We're roommates.

49
00:05:03,792 --> 00:05:06,627
Yeah. I could just stay
downstairs on the couch.

50
00:05:06,761 --> 00:05:08,830
- What? Don't be ridiculous.
- If you want, yeah.

51
00:05:08,964 --> 00:05:10,932
It's a couple weeks.
It's gonna be fine.

52
00:05:11,066 --> 00:05:13,168
Come on in.
Make yourself comfortable.

53
00:05:13,301 --> 00:05:16,171
- Oh! You're gonna...
- Whoa!

54
00:05:18,273 --> 00:05:20,775
- You okay?
- Don't tell your mother!

55
00:05:21,977 --> 00:05:25,380
This goes there. There.

56
00:05:25,512 --> 00:05:28,049
That's in there.

57
00:05:28,183 --> 00:05:30,185
- All right, let's try it.
- Okay, let's see.

58
00:05:30,318 --> 00:05:32,454
All right, so there's that.

59
00:05:32,586 --> 00:05:34,322
There's this. There's this.

60
00:05:34,456 --> 00:05:37,759
The blue light, the red,
the green light.

61
00:05:39,661 --> 00:05:42,629
Oh, look at you two.
How sweet is this?

62
00:05:42,764 --> 00:05:46,001
Okay, I have to leave for work
before either of you gets up.

63
00:05:46,134 --> 00:05:47,969
The heater guy's
coming in the morning.

64
00:05:48,103 --> 00:05:50,305
I'm gonna meet
my friends for brunch at 10.

65
00:05:50,438 --> 00:05:52,140
That'll be nice.
Where are you going?

66
00:05:52,273 --> 00:05:55,977
- Um... Nora's.
- What are you going there for?

67
00:05:56,111 --> 00:05:57,578
All the restaurants
in Brantford,

68
00:05:57,712 --> 00:05:59,681
- you gotta go to that one?
- I didn't pick.

69
00:05:59,814 --> 00:06:02,150
What difference does it make?
It's been years.

70
00:06:02,283 --> 00:06:04,252
I love you, honey.
I'm so glad you're home.

71
00:06:04,386 --> 00:06:05,653
Love you too, Mom.

72
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,197
Getting old sucks. Don't let
anybody tell you any different.

73
00:06:16,331 --> 00:06:18,833
You still got
that little girlfriend?

74
00:06:18,967 --> 00:06:21,002
No.

75
00:06:21,136 --> 00:06:22,804
We're not together anymore.

76
00:06:22,937 --> 00:06:24,873
I don't think.

77
00:06:25,006 --> 00:06:26,875
Was it her or you?

78
00:06:27,008 --> 00:06:28,777
- It's complicated.
- Try me.

79
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:31,780
We'll see
if I can understand.

80
00:06:31,913 --> 00:06:36,251
Well, when we
first got together,

81
00:06:36,384 --> 00:06:37,618
we were...

82
00:06:39,187 --> 00:06:42,924
sort of different people
than we are now.

83
00:06:44,292 --> 00:06:46,828
I mean, last year was...

84
00:06:46,961 --> 00:06:48,696
amazing.

85
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,698
I was a senior in high school.

86
00:06:50,832 --> 00:06:52,901
I had a girlfriend.

87
00:06:53,034 --> 00:06:56,905
Like, I finally figured out
who I was or something.

88
00:06:57,038 --> 00:06:59,140
Mm.

89
00:06:59,274 --> 00:07:02,043
I wish I could just feel
like that again, I guess.

90
00:07:05,346 --> 00:07:06,481
I don't know.

91
00:07:06,613 --> 00:07:08,615
Long-distance
relationships are hard.

92
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:12,720
I mean, I know everybody says
that, but turns out it's true.

93
00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:17,025
Can I give you a little advice?
Listen to me.

94
00:07:17,158 --> 00:07:20,228
Every single day
on every single subway car,

95
00:07:20,361 --> 00:07:22,931
there's lots of ladies
in New York City.

96
00:07:23,064 --> 00:07:27,702
And one in five of them, I would
marry, no questions asked.

97
00:07:27,836 --> 00:07:30,637
This is the best time
of your life.

98
00:07:30,772 --> 00:07:32,941
- It is?
- Yes, it is.

99
00:07:33,074 --> 00:07:36,010
So pull it together! It doesn't
get any better than this.

100
00:07:36,144 --> 00:07:38,947
It's all downhill from here.

101
00:08:28,863 --> 00:08:31,166
Bravestone.

102
00:09:27,455 --> 00:09:28,356
Hi!

103
00:09:28,489 --> 00:09:29,724
Yay, yay, yay!

104
00:09:29,857 --> 00:09:31,292
- Ooh!
- Oh, gosh, how are you?

105
00:09:31,426 --> 00:09:34,195
- Oh, my God, you look amazing.
- Thank you.

106
00:09:34,329 --> 00:09:35,730
Ho, ho, ho!

107
00:09:35,863 --> 00:09:37,532
- Fridge.
- Fridge!

108
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:39,033
- Come here.
- Ooh!

109
00:09:39,167 --> 00:09:41,636
So we were building houses
for two months,

110
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:44,205
and then on the way home,
we stopped in Costa Rica,

111
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:46,641
which was also amazing.

112
00:09:46,774 --> 00:09:49,043
That is so awesome.
I am so happy for you.

113
00:09:49,177 --> 00:09:50,745
That is so cool.

114
00:09:50,878 --> 00:09:53,881
So, "M," that's what
we're supposed to call you now?

115
00:09:54,015 --> 00:09:56,284
You don't have to.
It's just a nickname.

116
00:09:56,417 --> 00:09:58,453
One of my college friends
gave me that.

117
00:09:58,586 --> 00:10:00,388
You don't have to call me that.

118
00:10:00,521 --> 00:10:02,557
M. I love it. It's so hot.

119
00:10:02,691 --> 00:10:05,059
- Okay.
- But you and Spencer,

120
00:10:05,193 --> 00:10:08,896
- you're still not...?
- Yeah. No. Um, we're...

121
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:11,032
We're still,
like, taking a break.

122
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:14,402
Where is he, by the way?

123
00:10:33,388 --> 00:10:35,290
Eh, Christ.

124
00:10:35,423 --> 00:10:37,693
What do you want, Milo?

125
00:10:37,825 --> 00:10:39,527
Nice to see you too.

126
00:10:41,664 --> 00:10:45,300
Yes, I'd love to come in
for a cup of coffee.

127
00:10:45,433 --> 00:10:46,868
Thanks for asking.

128
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,142
You mind if I make some eggs?

129
00:10:54,275 --> 00:10:55,843
Do whatever you want.
I don't care.

130
00:10:55,977 --> 00:10:57,979
Just hurry up.
I don't have all day.

131
00:10:58,112 --> 00:10:59,514
You going somewhere?

132
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:04,687
Have, um...?

133
00:11:04,819 --> 00:11:08,589
Have you been in touch
with Spencer much?

134
00:11:08,724 --> 00:11:09,957
Yeah...

135
00:11:11,727 --> 00:11:13,494
You know what?

136
00:11:13,628 --> 00:11:15,129
Not really, actually.

137
00:11:15,263 --> 00:11:18,533
I text him a lot, but
he doesn't always text me back.

138
00:11:18,667 --> 00:11:19,934
- I know.
- It's just...

139
00:11:20,068 --> 00:11:21,602
I've been crazed lately

140
00:11:21,737 --> 00:11:23,938
with, you know,
classes and practices,

141
00:11:24,072 --> 00:11:25,640
and I got games
on the weekends.

142
00:11:25,774 --> 00:11:28,811
Yeah. Totally. Totally.

143
00:11:28,943 --> 00:11:32,715
I've just... I've been... I've
been a little worried about him.

144
00:11:35,784 --> 00:11:39,320
Okay, look, where...?
Where is this guy? For real.

145
00:11:43,324 --> 00:11:44,760
Good?

146
00:11:44,892 --> 00:11:47,763
- Meh.
- What do you mean, "Meh"?

147
00:11:47,895 --> 00:11:50,331
Meh! What do you want already?

148
00:11:50,465 --> 00:11:51,933
You've been calling
and calling.

149
00:11:52,066 --> 00:11:54,502
You show up out of the blue
after 15 years.

150
00:11:54,635 --> 00:11:57,271
Why? 'Cause you wanna
make some eggs?

151
00:12:01,876 --> 00:12:04,278
You remember
when we first opened,

152
00:12:04,412 --> 00:12:08,082
we had that
little dishwasher, Morris?

153
00:12:08,216 --> 00:12:09,984
Yeah, of course
I remember Morris.

154
00:12:10,118 --> 00:12:12,019
Worked the dinner shift.

155
00:12:12,153 --> 00:12:15,758
Six days a week,
2 in the morning most nights.

156
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:19,927
- The dishwasher.
- Little Morris. Mm.

157
00:12:20,061 --> 00:12:22,865
He wouldn't even touch those
saucepans until he was done

158
00:12:22,997 --> 00:12:26,501
with every single utensil
in the bin.

159
00:12:28,169 --> 00:12:30,571
Yeah, the man knew his craft.

160
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,207
Little Morris.

161
00:12:36,712 --> 00:12:38,312
Well, get... Wha...

162
00:12:38,446 --> 00:12:40,248
Just get to it, would you?

163
00:12:40,381 --> 00:12:42,885
I mean, it's always
the scenic route with you.

164
00:12:43,017 --> 00:12:45,721
I know what you want,
you want to apologize.

165
00:12:45,854 --> 00:12:47,823
And I hate to tell you,
I'm not interested.

166
00:12:49,691 --> 00:12:51,426
You think I'm supposed
to apologize?

167
00:12:53,027 --> 00:12:53,995
Oh, heater guy.

168
00:12:56,931 --> 00:12:59,066
- Grandpa Eddie?
- Anthony?

169
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,268
Yes, sir, it's me.

170
00:13:00,401 --> 00:13:02,136
Anthony!

171
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:03,404
How are you?

172
00:13:03,538 --> 00:13:05,273
Come on in. Come on in.

173
00:13:08,276 --> 00:13:10,913
- How you doing?
- Oh, getting old sucks.

174
00:13:11,045 --> 00:13:12,915
Don't let anybody
tell you any different.

175
00:13:13,047 --> 00:13:15,884
Heh, heh. Oh, uh, this is
uh, Martha and-and Bethany.

176
00:13:16,017 --> 00:13:17,719
This is Spencer's
grandfather, Eddie.

177
00:13:17,853 --> 00:13:20,388
Martha?
You're the little girlfriend.

178
00:13:20,521 --> 00:13:22,223
- Uh...
- Morning!

179
00:13:22,356 --> 00:13:24,592
Morning, sir.
Sorry to barge in on you.

180
00:13:24,726 --> 00:13:26,961
You're not barging.
He's barging.

181
00:13:27,094 --> 00:13:28,931
Milo Walker.

182
00:13:29,063 --> 00:13:32,266
Wait, Milo? Like...
Like Milo and Eddie's.

183
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,101
- Pleased to meet you.
- Man, my dad said

184
00:13:34,235 --> 00:13:35,771
you guys had
the best restaurant.

185
00:13:35,904 --> 00:13:38,506
We were just there.
Well, it's called Nora's now.

186
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,043
Pfft, Nora's.
It's barely even a restaurant.

187
00:13:42,176 --> 00:13:43,946
It's more like
a breakfast place now.

188
00:13:45,948 --> 00:13:47,515
Were you with Spencer?

189
00:13:47,648 --> 00:13:50,284
No, we came here
looking for him, actually.

190
00:13:50,418 --> 00:13:52,520
You all hungry?
Eggs on the griddle.

191
00:13:52,654 --> 00:13:54,455
- Might have to take a look.
- Hey, man,

192
00:13:54,589 --> 00:13:56,357
you can do more
than take a look at it.

193
00:13:56,491 --> 00:13:58,292
All right, all right. My man.

194
00:14:00,628 --> 00:14:05,533
- Whoa. Do you need a hand?
- Do I look like I need a hand?

195
00:14:11,072 --> 00:14:12,473
Martha?

196
00:14:16,244 --> 00:14:17,278
Hey.

197
00:14:19,146 --> 00:14:21,015
Where is he?

198
00:14:30,792 --> 00:14:33,060
- Do you hear that?
- Yes.

199
00:14:38,432 --> 00:14:40,368
You hear something?

200
00:14:40,501 --> 00:14:42,436
It's probably the heater.
It's broken.

201
00:14:47,308 --> 00:14:49,076
How did it
even get here?

202
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:50,913
I don't know.

203
00:14:51,045 --> 00:14:52,948
Maybe he...
I don't know,

204
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,349
maybe he went back for it
or something?

205
00:14:56,752 --> 00:14:59,186
Is he trying
to fix it?

206
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,857
Why would anyone
try to fix that thing?

207
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:03,591
I don't know.

208
00:15:03,725 --> 00:15:06,762
I don't know. Maybe he went
to buy parts or something?

209
00:15:06,895 --> 00:15:08,764
Okay, look,
I'm calling him again.

210
00:15:08,897 --> 00:15:11,934
I'm sure everything's... fine.

211
00:15:31,419 --> 00:15:33,287
Fourteen texts
and four missed calls.

212
00:15:36,925 --> 00:15:38,426
I don't think he went out.

213
00:15:40,194 --> 00:15:41,228
I think...

214
00:15:43,097 --> 00:15:44,666
I think he went back in.

215
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,970
No, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no...

216
00:15:48,135 --> 00:15:49,170
- What? No. Why...?
- Come on, man!

217
00:15:49,303 --> 00:15:50,471
Why would he do that?

218
00:15:50,605 --> 00:15:52,239
Remember what it was like?

219
00:15:52,373 --> 00:15:54,910
- I got eaten by a fricking hippo!
- I got killed by a piece of cake!

220
00:15:55,043 --> 00:15:56,812
Guys, guys.

221
00:15:56,945 --> 00:15:59,614
How is he gonna get out?

222
00:15:59,748 --> 00:16:03,284
Uh, he's gotta take the...
The green jewel.

223
00:16:03,417 --> 00:16:05,787
And stick it back
in the statue thing.

224
00:16:05,921 --> 00:16:07,022
By himself?

225
00:16:22,603 --> 00:16:23,739
We gotta go get him.

226
00:16:23,872 --> 00:16:25,272
Are you crazy?

227
00:16:25,406 --> 00:16:27,608
- I'm coming with you.
- Are you out of your minds?

228
00:16:27,743 --> 00:16:30,444
We can do this. We've been
there. We know what to expect.

229
00:16:30,578 --> 00:16:32,580
I gotta stop hanging out
with white people.

230
00:16:32,714 --> 00:16:33,915
I don't know what's
wrong with me.

231
00:16:34,049 --> 00:16:36,584
She's right. We played
before and we won.

232
00:16:36,718 --> 00:16:38,152
We barely survived!

233
00:16:38,285 --> 00:16:41,023
You know
he would do it for you.

234
00:16:41,155 --> 00:16:42,124
For any of us.

235
00:16:49,497 --> 00:16:52,134
Be careful.
It looks pretty busted.

236
00:16:57,505 --> 00:16:59,240
<i>Welcome to Jumanji.</i>

237
00:16:59,373 --> 00:17:03,544
What...? We haven't even
picked our guys yet!

238
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:05,479
What?

239
00:17:05,613 --> 00:17:09,885
Okay, okay. Here we go. Oh, I
hate this part. All right. Okay.

240
00:17:12,186 --> 00:17:14,522
This is not happening!

241
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:23,799
You guys?

242
00:17:27,669 --> 00:17:28,870
No!

243
00:17:47,656 --> 00:17:49,091
Am I...?

244
00:17:49,223 --> 00:17:51,225
Is it...? I can't believe...

245
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:54,029
Oh!

246
00:17:57,032 --> 00:17:58,532
Oh, it's her.

247
00:17:58,667 --> 00:17:59,567
I'm her.

248
00:18:07,075 --> 00:18:08,242
Spencer.

249
00:18:09,343 --> 00:18:10,578
Spencer?

250
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:17,719
What in tarnation?

251
00:18:17,853 --> 00:18:19,788
Where am I?

252
00:18:19,921 --> 00:18:22,423
What the hell is this?

253
00:18:22,556 --> 00:18:25,426
Oh, my God.

254
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:26,594
Eddie?

255
00:18:28,529 --> 00:18:32,100
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm Milo Walker. Who are you?

256
00:18:32,234 --> 00:18:34,236
Milo?

257
00:18:34,368 --> 00:18:35,737
What on earth? What...?

258
00:18:36,872 --> 00:18:37,906
- What the...?
- Oh, my.

259
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:39,107
Wait a minute.

260
00:18:39,241 --> 00:18:40,709
Oh, Lord.

261
00:18:40,842 --> 00:18:43,111
- This isn't happening.
- Pardon me?

262
00:18:43,245 --> 00:18:46,313
- Who are you?
- You're Spencer's grandfather.

263
00:18:46,447 --> 00:18:49,583
- Yeah, no kidding.
- And you are Milo.

264
00:18:49,718 --> 00:18:51,086
I certainly am.

265
00:18:51,219 --> 00:18:53,354
I'm Martha, Spencer's...

266
00:18:53,487 --> 00:18:55,489
You're the little girlfriend?

267
00:18:55,623 --> 00:18:57,125
- Look out!
- What?

268
00:18:58,626 --> 00:19:01,495
- Ah! Oh, oh!
- Oh, Lord.

269
00:19:01,629 --> 00:19:04,498
That hurt like a goddamn...

270
00:19:04,632 --> 00:19:08,302
- Bethany?
- What? I'm not...

271
00:19:08,435 --> 00:19:10,304
No.

272
00:19:10,437 --> 00:19:13,975
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no...

273
00:19:14,109 --> 00:19:15,210
Yo!

274
00:19:15,342 --> 00:19:20,182
Oh, no, no, no.
This can't be happening!

275
00:19:20,314 --> 00:19:21,216
Fridge?

276
00:19:21,348 --> 00:19:23,350
Yes, I'm Fridge, goddamn it!

277
00:19:23,484 --> 00:19:25,452
The hell, man?

278
00:19:25,586 --> 00:19:28,824
Okay.
Okay, something went wrong.

279
00:19:28,957 --> 00:19:29,925
You think?

280
00:19:33,161 --> 00:19:35,263
Holy...

281
00:19:35,396 --> 00:19:37,431
Wait. If I'm...

282
00:19:37,565 --> 00:19:39,633
Then you...? Spencer?

283
00:19:39,768 --> 00:19:42,003
Why does everybody
keep calling me Spencer?

284
00:19:42,137 --> 00:19:46,675
No, that is Grandpa Eddie.
And that, heh... is Milo.

285
00:19:46,808 --> 00:19:48,210
Pleased to meet you.

286
00:19:48,342 --> 00:19:49,845
What?

287
00:19:49,978 --> 00:19:51,947
Then where's Bethany?
And where's Spencer?

288
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,647
I don't know! Okay?

289
00:19:53,782 --> 00:19:56,051
The game, it didn't
let us pick our avatars, so...

290
00:19:56,184 --> 00:19:58,019
- Because it's busted!
- Yeah, okay.

291
00:19:58,153 --> 00:19:59,486
Are we dead?

292
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:02,257
You know, I was just
wondering the same thing.

293
00:20:02,389 --> 00:20:04,226
Did I die and turn into

294
00:20:04,358 --> 00:20:07,696
some kind of a small,
muscular Boy Scout?

295
00:20:07,829 --> 00:20:10,832
- We're not dead.
- So then what's going on here?

296
00:20:10,966 --> 00:20:13,101
Okay, this is gonna sound
very, uh, strange,

297
00:20:13,235 --> 00:20:16,204
but we are in
a video game called <i>Jumanji,</i>

298
00:20:16,338 --> 00:20:20,842
and we are in the bodies
of video game characters, heh.

299
00:20:20,976 --> 00:20:22,844
And we've been here before,
Fridge and I.

300
00:20:22,978 --> 00:20:24,679
- Last time, I was you.
- Mm.

301
00:20:24,813 --> 00:20:27,414
- Huh?
- We're in a game!

302
00:20:27,548 --> 00:20:29,684
We gotta find Spencer
'cause he's in here too.

303
00:20:29,818 --> 00:20:31,887
- Spencer?
- Yes.

304
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,755
- He's here?
- Yes.

305
00:20:33,889 --> 00:20:35,489
Spencer, Eddie's grandson?

306
00:20:35,623 --> 00:20:37,391
Yes. Spencer.

307
00:20:37,524 --> 00:20:39,761
- He's here too?
- Yes!

308
00:20:39,895 --> 00:20:41,395
He's here,
and we gotta find him.

309
00:20:41,528 --> 00:20:43,899
So it's like
a hide-and-go-seek situation.

310
00:20:44,966 --> 00:20:46,500
I'm not "it."

311
00:20:46,634 --> 00:20:47,869
Hm...

312
00:20:51,172 --> 00:20:52,941
My hip feels
pretty good now.

313
00:20:55,944 --> 00:20:58,246
Oh, my joints
feel like butter.

314
00:20:59,413 --> 00:21:01,950
- Oh, yeah, look at those.
- Wow.

315
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:05,220
Look at these.
Look at what I got.

316
00:21:05,353 --> 00:21:08,723
- Uh, we have some issues here.
- You're telling me this?

317
00:21:08,857 --> 00:21:10,491
I'm the old fat dude.

318
00:21:10,624 --> 00:21:12,761
I came back, and things
actually got worse.

319
00:21:12,894 --> 00:21:14,729
At least last time
I was still black.

320
00:21:17,766 --> 00:21:20,835
Well, look at
this little fella.

321
00:21:20,969 --> 00:21:22,503
Hello there. Heh.

322
00:21:22,636 --> 00:21:24,806
Mr. Walker, don't get
too close to the water!

323
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:27,809
- Get away from there!
- I'm sorry, what'd you say now?

324
00:21:32,247 --> 00:21:33,949
Hey! Ahh!

325
00:21:36,017 --> 00:21:37,285
Get on out of here!

326
00:21:38,954 --> 00:21:40,155
What just happened?

327
00:21:40,288 --> 00:21:41,656
What the hell
was that thing?

328
00:21:44,893 --> 00:21:51,465
Well, that there
was a hippopotamus. Mm-hm.

329
00:21:51,598 --> 00:21:53,401
And they are awfully fast.

330
00:21:53,534 --> 00:21:56,271
Faster than a horse,
if you can believe that.

331
00:21:56,404 --> 00:21:59,841
And they've got
an awful ferocious bite.

332
00:21:59,975 --> 00:22:02,609
How about that?
You know, the funny thing is,

333
00:22:02,744 --> 00:22:04,879
I don't remember...

334
00:22:05,013 --> 00:22:08,482
knowing much about hippos
until right now.

335
00:22:08,615 --> 00:22:10,018
You're a zoologist.

336
00:22:10,151 --> 00:22:13,822
- I'm sorry, what now?
- Are we in Florida?

337
00:22:13,955 --> 00:22:17,692
Just listen.
This is a dangerous place.

338
00:22:17,826 --> 00:22:19,060
Crazy dangerous.

339
00:22:19,194 --> 00:22:21,162
But Martha and I,
we've been here before.

340
00:22:21,296 --> 00:22:25,532
We know what we're doing. You
gotta stay alert all the time.

341
00:22:25,667 --> 00:22:29,671
If I'm near water, I got one eye
on the water, you hear me?

342
00:22:29,804 --> 00:22:32,207
You got to have eyes
in the back of your...

343
00:22:36,811 --> 00:22:38,645
Oh, God.

344
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:42,350
What in the Sam Hill
just happened to him?

345
00:22:48,123 --> 00:22:50,325
Shut the front door.

346
00:22:50,458 --> 00:22:51,826
What the hell
happened to you?

347
00:22:53,995 --> 00:22:55,063
Damn!

348
00:22:58,166 --> 00:22:59,167
A plane?

349
00:23:00,201 --> 00:23:03,371
What? Come on! Follow me!

350
00:23:03,505 --> 00:23:05,407
Come on, let's go.
Let's go. Follow us.

351
00:23:13,748 --> 00:23:15,549
Welcome to Jumanji.

352
00:23:15,683 --> 00:23:17,786
- Why is he in a plane?
- I don't know.

353
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,954
Well, don't just stand there.
Hop in!

354
00:23:24,591 --> 00:23:26,961
Strap in.
There's no time to spare.

355
00:23:30,899 --> 00:23:33,334
Dr. Bravestone,
famed archeologist

356
00:23:33,468 --> 00:23:35,236
and international explorer,

357
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:37,038
I'm so glad you've returned.

358
00:23:37,172 --> 00:23:39,841
I've been so anxious
for your arrival.

359
00:23:39,974 --> 00:23:41,342
- You talking to me?
- Yes.

360
00:23:41,476 --> 00:23:43,610
Once again, Jumanji
is in great peril,

361
00:23:43,745 --> 00:23:44,946
and only you can help.

362
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,748
Nigel, we're looking
for our friend.

363
00:23:46,881 --> 00:23:49,951
- Have you seen, like, anyone...?
- Ruby Roundhouse, killer of men,

364
00:23:50,085 --> 00:23:51,886
welcome to Jumanji.

365
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:55,622
- "Killer of men"?
- Yeah, I, uh... I kill guys.

366
00:23:55,757 --> 00:23:57,392
I'm so glad you've returned.

367
00:23:57,525 --> 00:23:59,626
I've been so anxious
for your arrival.

368
00:23:59,761 --> 00:24:02,230
- What's with this fella?
- My dearest Mouse,

369
00:24:02,363 --> 00:24:03,665
surely you remember me.

370
00:24:03,798 --> 00:24:05,467
Nigel Billingsly
at your service.

371
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:08,570
Hey. Nigel,
I thought that was you.

372
00:24:08,703 --> 00:24:10,772
He's a... Uh, what is it called?

373
00:24:10,905 --> 00:24:14,109
- NPC, a non-player character.
- He's not a real person.

374
00:24:14,242 --> 00:24:16,845
He only has a limited
number of things he can say.

375
00:24:16,978 --> 00:24:19,481
Mm, my friend Carl
is just like that.

376
00:24:19,613 --> 00:24:21,116
Nigel, we're looking
for someone.

377
00:24:21,249 --> 00:24:22,684
Has anyone arrived
in Jumanji...?

378
00:24:22,817 --> 00:24:24,452
Jumanji is in great peril.

379
00:24:24,586 --> 00:24:27,355
It's all detailed in the letter
I sent you, Dr. Bravestone.

380
00:24:27,489 --> 00:24:29,757
Perhaps you should
read it aloud.

381
00:24:29,891 --> 00:24:31,359
Grandpa Eddie.

382
00:24:31,493 --> 00:24:33,761
- Do you have a letter?
- Do I have a letter?

383
00:24:33,895 --> 00:24:36,264
- Check your pockets.
- Why would I have a letter?

384
00:24:36,397 --> 00:24:37,832
Nigel here
wrote you a letter.

385
00:24:37,966 --> 00:24:39,601
I didn't get a letter
from this guy.

386
00:24:39,734 --> 00:24:41,503
But we are
in a video game, and...

387
00:24:41,635 --> 00:24:43,505
We're in a video game?

388
00:24:43,637 --> 00:24:44,672
We're gonna die.

389
00:24:44,806 --> 00:24:46,741
- We did die.
- Are we in hell?

390
00:24:46,875 --> 00:24:48,243
- I knew it.
- Oh, my God.

391
00:24:48,376 --> 00:24:50,145
It's detailed
in the letter I sent you,

392
00:24:50,278 --> 00:24:52,180
Dr. Bravestone.
You should read it aloud.

393
00:24:52,313 --> 00:24:55,183
I don't have a letter! How many
times I gotta tell you that?

394
00:24:55,316 --> 00:24:57,752
Oh, no, Eddie.
It's in your hand.

395
00:24:59,387 --> 00:25:00,855
Where did this come from?

396
00:25:00,989 --> 00:25:04,092
You got to pay attention
to what's in your hand.

397
00:25:04,225 --> 00:25:06,561
Perhaps you should
read it aloud.

398
00:25:09,164 --> 00:25:12,000
"Dr. Bravestone,
it is my solemn hope

399
00:25:12,133 --> 00:25:15,203
that this letter finds you,
for again..."

400
00:25:15,336 --> 00:25:18,973
<i>Jumanji is in grave danger.
We need your help at once.</i>

401
00:25:19,107 --> 00:25:20,909
<i>Whoa, what's going on here?</i>

402
00:25:21,042 --> 00:25:23,211
<i>It's a cutscene.
It's how we find...</i>

403
00:25:23,344 --> 00:25:24,579
<i>I'll explain afterwards.</i>

404
00:25:24,712 --> 00:25:26,414
<i>You see, our worst nightmare</i>

405
00:25:26,548 --> 00:25:27,916
<i>has come to pass,</i>

406
00:25:28,049 --> 00:25:31,052
<i>for Jurgen the Brutal
has returned.</i>

407
00:25:31,186 --> 00:25:34,389
<i>Indeed, that most vicious
Jumanjian conqueror is back.</i>

408
00:25:35,557 --> 00:25:36,724
<i>And he's brought with him</i>

409
00:25:36,858 --> 00:25:38,661
<i>his savage horde.</i>

410
00:25:38,793 --> 00:25:42,530
<i>They descended from their
fortress atop Mount Zhatmire</i>

411
00:25:42,665 --> 00:25:46,669
<i>and made their way south
to the Avian Province,</i>

412
00:25:46,801 --> 00:25:49,404
<i>home of the sacred
Falcon Jewel,</i>

413
00:25:49,537 --> 00:25:51,806
<i>worn around the neck
of the village elder.</i>

414
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:54,209
<i>The Falcon is
the fertility jewel of Jumanji,</i>

415
00:25:54,342 --> 00:25:56,077
<i>and it has been guarded
by the people</i>

416
00:25:56,211 --> 00:25:59,013
<i>of the Avian Province
for hundreds of years.</i>

417
00:25:59,147 --> 00:26:01,316
<i>So long as the jewel
can see the sun,</i>

418
00:26:01,449 --> 00:26:05,019
<i>the waters will flow
and the land will flourish.</i>

419
00:26:11,726 --> 00:26:13,061
Yeah!

420
00:26:21,704 --> 00:26:24,539
<i>Many brave souls died that day,</i>

421
00:26:24,673 --> 00:26:27,141
<i>but Jurgen got
what he came for.</i>

422
00:26:27,275 --> 00:26:29,577
<i>He stowed the jewel
in darkness,</i>

423
00:26:29,712 --> 00:26:31,379
<i>hidden from the sun.</i>

424
00:26:43,324 --> 00:26:44,926
<i>A drought befell the land.</i>

425
00:26:45,059 --> 00:26:47,128
<i>The crops dried out and died.</i>

426
00:26:47,262 --> 00:26:49,397
<i>And if the jewel
is not returned soon,</i>

427
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:51,266
<i>it may be too late.</i>

428
00:26:51,399 --> 00:26:52,867
<i>Which is why we called for you</i>

429
00:26:53,001 --> 00:26:54,869
<i>and your brilliant associates.</i>

430
00:26:55,003 --> 00:26:56,604
<i>I understand
the enormous weight</i>

431
00:26:56,739 --> 00:26:58,973
<i>that this must carry for you,
Dr. Bravestone,</i>

432
00:26:59,107 --> 00:27:01,776
<i>how this adventure
is like no other,</i>

433
00:27:01,909 --> 00:27:04,379
<i>since it was Jurgen the Brutal</i>

434
00:27:04,512 --> 00:27:06,715
<i>who killed your parents.</i>

435
00:27:09,851 --> 00:27:11,352
No, no, no, no!

436
00:27:13,955 --> 00:27:15,423
- Huh?
- He killed

437
00:27:15,556 --> 00:27:17,458
- Dr. Bravestone's parents?
- Indeed, he did.

438
00:27:17,592 --> 00:27:20,928
- When the doctor was just a boy.
- Oh, well, that's terrible.

439
00:27:21,062 --> 00:27:23,965
I can't say this enough:
We're in a video game.

440
00:27:24,098 --> 00:27:26,669
You must recover the jewel
from Jurgen the Brutal

441
00:27:26,801 --> 00:27:28,269
and show it to the sun.

442
00:27:28,403 --> 00:27:31,139
He's making his way north
across the desert now.

443
00:27:31,272 --> 00:27:34,108
Jurgen the Brutal.
Is that Barbara's boy?

444
00:27:34,242 --> 00:27:36,477
And remember, the goal
is to recover the loot.

445
00:27:36,611 --> 00:27:38,479
To wrest it from
the hands of the brute.

446
00:27:38,613 --> 00:27:40,148
And if you wish
to leave the game,

447
00:27:40,281 --> 00:27:42,583
you must save Jumanji
and call out its name.

448
00:27:42,718 --> 00:27:46,087
Excuse me. Who is Jumanji?

449
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:49,624
Well, if I was listening
correctly, that is her sister.

450
00:27:49,758 --> 00:27:51,159
Here's your map.

451
00:27:52,894 --> 00:27:55,630
Find an oasis and follow
the flame to the desert fruit.

452
00:27:55,764 --> 00:27:57,598
- Huh?
- I can't land here,

453
00:27:57,733 --> 00:27:59,300
so you're going
to have to drop in.

454
00:27:59,434 --> 00:28:00,835
- What?
- No, no. Nigel...

455
00:28:00,968 --> 00:28:02,537
- I'll get as low as I can.
- Hold on.

456
00:28:02,671 --> 00:28:04,005
- Get ready.
- What do you mean?

457
00:28:04,138 --> 00:28:05,006
We don't have parachutes.

458
00:28:05,139 --> 00:28:06,441
Shouldn't we have...? Ahh!

459
00:28:06,574 --> 00:28:08,343
- What the hell?
- Good luck.

460
00:28:08,476 --> 00:28:10,311
The future of Jumanji
is in your hands.

461
00:28:10,445 --> 00:28:12,313
Why did we take a plane
if there's nowhere to land?

462
00:28:12,447 --> 00:28:13,514
And go!

463
00:28:41,309 --> 00:28:43,411
The hell, man?

464
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:55,724
Where are we?

465
00:28:55,858 --> 00:28:57,492
Where's the jungle?

466
00:28:57,625 --> 00:28:59,394
What are we doing here?

467
00:28:59,527 --> 00:29:01,396
We've got to keep it
together, okay?

468
00:29:01,529 --> 00:29:02,865
- "Keep it together"?
- Yes.

469
00:29:02,997 --> 00:29:04,399
This is
a whole new thing.

470
00:29:04,532 --> 00:29:06,668
Nobody said we'd have to do
a whole new thing.

471
00:29:06,802 --> 00:29:09,570
And by the way, what the hell
happened to Bethany?

472
00:29:30,057 --> 00:29:32,593
So, what part of New
Hampshire is this exactly?

473
00:29:32,728 --> 00:29:34,763
We're not
in New Hampshire, Milo.

474
00:29:34,897 --> 00:29:36,799
That's right. Exactly.
Not New Hampshire.

475
00:29:36,931 --> 00:29:38,801
- You're starting to get it now?
- Nope.

476
00:29:38,933 --> 00:29:41,402
I don't have the foggiest clue
what's going on here.

477
00:29:41,536 --> 00:29:43,571
That guy kept calling me
Dr. Braverman,

478
00:29:43,705 --> 00:29:45,339
which is the name
of my orthopedist.

479
00:29:45,473 --> 00:29:47,743
I'm thinking I just had
another hip surgery

480
00:29:47,876 --> 00:29:49,410
and now I'm coming out of it.

481
00:29:49,544 --> 00:29:52,480
Hey! Check this out!

482
00:29:57,952 --> 00:30:00,656
Okay.
We have to find Spencer.

483
00:30:00,789 --> 00:30:03,458
To do that, I think we have
to start playing the game.

484
00:30:03,591 --> 00:30:06,227
I'm sure that's what he did.
We find him,

485
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,063
finish the game,
and we go home.

486
00:30:09,197 --> 00:30:11,599
Ed, you okay?

487
00:30:11,733 --> 00:30:14,502
Would you look at me?

488
00:30:14,635 --> 00:30:16,504
I'm back.

489
00:30:16,637 --> 00:30:18,506
I haven't looked
like this since...

490
00:30:18,639 --> 00:30:19,942
Never.

491
00:30:20,074 --> 00:30:22,143
You looked like this never.

492
00:30:22,276 --> 00:30:24,512
What? When I was younger,
I was in great shape.

493
00:30:24,645 --> 00:30:26,481
I remember you
when you were younger,

494
00:30:26,614 --> 00:30:29,818
and... this is not
what you looked like.

495
00:30:29,952 --> 00:30:31,986
I think my eyes
are a different color.

496
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:34,355
All of you
is a different color.

497
00:30:34,489 --> 00:30:38,292
It's a good look on me,
huh? Huh?

498
00:30:38,426 --> 00:30:40,696
Okay.
They're headed north.

499
00:30:40,829 --> 00:30:43,064
- Which way is north?
- I have no idea.

500
00:30:43,197 --> 00:30:46,835
- Well, you wanna check the map?
- Right. I'm the map guy now.

501
00:30:46,969 --> 00:30:50,939
"Find an oasis and follow
the flame to the desert fruit."

502
00:30:51,072 --> 00:30:53,809
Follow the flame
to the desert fruit.

503
00:30:53,942 --> 00:30:55,443
You know there's
nothing on that?

504
00:30:55,576 --> 00:30:56,778
He can see it,
you can't.

505
00:30:56,912 --> 00:30:58,881
Each place on the map
is a different level,

506
00:30:59,013 --> 00:31:01,349
and the levels
get harder as we go.

507
00:31:01,482 --> 00:31:03,384
This one is called...

508
00:31:03,518 --> 00:31:05,553
"Dunes."

509
00:31:05,687 --> 00:31:07,321
No shit.

510
00:31:09,691 --> 00:31:11,860
Who the hell is that?

511
00:31:16,597 --> 00:31:18,967
Oh, that's an ostrich.

512
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:22,905
- Oh, no.
- Yes, indeed.

513
00:31:23,037 --> 00:31:26,675
That is an ostrich.

514
00:31:26,808 --> 00:31:29,745
The ostrich
is a flightless bird,

515
00:31:29,878 --> 00:31:32,113
one of 60 species.

516
00:31:32,246 --> 00:31:36,183
You got the penguin, you got
the emu, and you got the kiwi.

517
00:31:36,317 --> 00:31:39,220
Heh, heh, funny thing is,
I don't remember knowing...

518
00:31:39,353 --> 00:31:40,889
You're a zoologist.

519
00:31:41,023 --> 00:31:43,057
I was a zoologist last time.
It's important.

520
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:45,359
Maybe if we could get through
this quicker.

521
00:31:45,493 --> 00:31:50,398
Well, another thing is, they can
run up to 45 miles per hour,

522
00:31:50,531 --> 00:31:54,168
which makes them the world's
fastest two-legged animal.

523
00:31:54,302 --> 00:31:56,905
Did you know that?
Fascinating.

524
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:02,276
- What a magnificent creature.
- We should get out of here.

525
00:32:03,644 --> 00:32:05,546
What else do you know?

526
00:32:05,681 --> 00:32:07,248
Here's another
interesting fact.

527
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:11,252
They have three stomachs.
How about that?

528
00:32:12,553 --> 00:32:15,791
Ah! Come on.
Beat it!

529
00:32:15,924 --> 00:32:17,558
Don't get so close.

530
00:32:17,693 --> 00:32:20,963
Just a bird, okay? Come on,
get moving. Get out of here.

531
00:32:21,095 --> 00:32:23,397
- Anything else we need to know?
- Beat it, bird.

532
00:32:23,531 --> 00:32:25,801
Another interesting thing
about the ostrich...

533
00:32:25,934 --> 00:32:27,903
I said scram,
you stupid bird!

534
00:32:28,036 --> 00:32:30,072
- ...is when threatened...
- Get out of here!

535
00:32:30,237 --> 00:32:31,673
...they attack.

536
00:32:34,275 --> 00:32:36,078
Oh, my!

537
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,781
- Eddie! Eddie!
- Oh!

538
00:32:39,915 --> 00:32:42,416
Where's Eddie? Is he dead?

539
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:44,086
- Yes.
- No. Yes, he died,

540
00:32:44,218 --> 00:32:45,954
but he's fine.

541
00:32:46,088 --> 00:32:48,991
Did I just kill Eddie...

542
00:32:49,123 --> 00:32:50,993
by talking too slow...

543
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,062
like he always said
I would?

544
00:33:05,306 --> 00:33:09,176
Why does everybody keep
dropping from the sky?

545
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:13,614
Nurse, I'm gonna need to see
Dr. Braverman right now, please.

546
00:33:13,749 --> 00:33:16,084
I'm not your nurse.
Okay, listen.

547
00:33:16,217 --> 00:33:20,421
These tattoos on our arms,
that is your life count.

548
00:33:20,554 --> 00:33:21,857
We each have three lives.

549
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:24,458
You and Fridge
each have two left.

550
00:33:24,592 --> 00:33:26,128
If you lose all three,

551
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:28,897
listen to me,
it is game over.

552
00:33:29,031 --> 00:33:33,135
- That's it. You're dead.
- Dead like... "kaputski"?

553
00:33:33,267 --> 00:33:34,568
Yes.

554
00:33:34,703 --> 00:33:35,871
Kaputski.

555
00:33:41,143 --> 00:33:42,243
What the hell is that?

556
00:33:42,376 --> 00:33:44,079
- That's not good.
- Look.

557
00:33:52,821 --> 00:33:56,124
Oh, there's one more thing
about ostriches.

558
00:33:56,257 --> 00:33:57,191
Oh, no.

559
00:33:57,324 --> 00:33:58,392
Say it!

560
00:33:58,526 --> 00:34:00,829
They travel in herds.

561
00:34:05,867 --> 00:34:07,468
We gotta get out of here!

562
00:34:07,601 --> 00:34:10,138
- Dune buggies, let's go!
- Come on, come on! Shake a leg!

563
00:34:10,271 --> 00:34:11,773
- Hey, wait.
- Why am I so slow?

564
00:34:11,907 --> 00:34:13,374
Haul ass, girl. Let's go!

565
00:34:13,507 --> 00:34:15,143
- Come on, come on!
- I'm coming, Eddie.

566
00:34:15,276 --> 00:34:16,978
- Go.
- Do you see the key anywhere?

567
00:34:17,112 --> 00:34:19,748
- Okay, how do I do this?
- I've never driven one of these!

568
00:34:23,952 --> 00:34:25,519
Maybe under the dash.

569
00:34:26,855 --> 00:34:28,857
- Green button!
- Green button. Go.

570
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:29,858
Go, go, go!

571
00:34:32,694 --> 00:34:33,627
Go, go.

572
00:34:43,071 --> 00:34:44,139
Oh, my God!

573
00:34:56,918 --> 00:34:58,019
Go.

574
00:34:58,153 --> 00:35:01,056
You are
a terrible driver.

575
00:35:01,189 --> 00:35:02,958
What are you talking about?
We're fine.

576
00:35:03,091 --> 00:35:05,292
Nobody fine. You... Oh! Oh, oh!

577
00:35:06,594 --> 00:35:08,697
Oh, no! Ahh, ahh!

578
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:11,066
Oh, help! Oh, oh!

579
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:13,101
Hold on, Eddie.
Please don't let go.

580
00:35:13,235 --> 00:35:16,104
Ahh! Oh! Oh, wow!

581
00:35:16,238 --> 00:35:17,739
Oh, help. Ahh!

582
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:26,915
Help. Eddie. Oh!

583
00:35:30,284 --> 00:35:32,254
Beat it!

584
00:35:32,386 --> 00:35:33,521
Get out of here!

585
00:35:37,926 --> 00:35:38,860
I think we lost them.

586
00:35:38,994 --> 00:35:39,995
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

587
00:35:56,178 --> 00:35:58,046
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

588
00:36:00,782 --> 00:36:02,017
Oh, no.

589
00:36:07,421 --> 00:36:08,322
- Ahh!
- What do we do?

590
00:36:08,455 --> 00:36:10,158
I don't know!

591
00:36:13,895 --> 00:36:15,664
Get in! Hurry!

592
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,176
Ha! Suckers!

593
00:36:35,516 --> 00:36:36,918
- Eddie...
- Uh-oh.

594
00:36:38,887 --> 00:36:42,324
- Oh, my...
- Whoa, whoa!

595
00:36:42,456 --> 00:36:45,327
- Oh, dude!
- Oh, dear.

596
00:36:47,696 --> 00:36:49,898
What do we do?

597
00:36:50,031 --> 00:36:51,032
What do we do?

598
00:36:55,469 --> 00:36:56,604
What are you doing?

599
00:36:56,738 --> 00:37:00,008
- Birds, birds, birds!
- Birds!

600
00:37:07,481 --> 00:37:10,551
- What the hell, man?
- They're flightless birds.

601
00:37:10,685 --> 00:37:14,055
This is a flightless
dune buggy!

602
00:37:14,189 --> 00:37:16,892
- Oh!
- Oh, no!

603
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:20,662
No, no, no!

604
00:37:20,795 --> 00:37:23,031
- We're not going to make it.
- We're gonna make it.

605
00:37:23,164 --> 00:37:25,233
- No, we're not!
- We're not gonna make it.

606
00:37:25,367 --> 00:37:26,533
We're gonna make it.

607
00:37:32,807 --> 00:37:34,441
We're not gonna make it.

608
00:37:45,086 --> 00:37:48,723
That was fantastic. Heh.

609
00:37:48,857 --> 00:37:50,424
- Oh, horrible driver.
- Whoo...

610
00:37:52,459 --> 00:37:55,730
Yeah, you see that, birds?
You don't mess with the kid.

611
00:37:55,864 --> 00:37:57,132
Right there!

612
00:38:01,435 --> 00:38:03,004
Did you see me?

613
00:38:03,138 --> 00:38:04,773
I was incredible.

614
00:38:04,906 --> 00:38:07,142
I mean, I saved you,
I saved you,

615
00:38:07,275 --> 00:38:11,713
I saved this guy from a bird
while I was driving a car.

616
00:38:11,846 --> 00:38:14,816
I was a machine.
I was relentless.

617
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:18,053
- I was fearless.
- Yes. Exactly. Fearless.

618
00:38:18,186 --> 00:38:21,289
That's Bravestone.
Okay, check this out.

619
00:38:23,425 --> 00:38:24,793
Oh, goodness.

620
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:27,594
What the hell?

621
00:38:27,729 --> 00:38:29,297
It's your strengths
and weaknesses.

622
00:38:29,431 --> 00:38:30,732
I... I mean your avatar,

623
00:38:30,865 --> 00:38:33,768
Dr. Bravestone's,
strengths and weaknesses.

624
00:38:33,902 --> 00:38:35,636
"Fearless," check.

625
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:38,173
"Speed. Climbing."
"Boomerang"?

626
00:38:39,441 --> 00:38:41,142
"Smoldering intensity"?

627
00:38:41,276 --> 00:38:44,012
- It's this stupid face you make.
- Huh?

628
00:38:47,614 --> 00:38:48,717
There it is.

629
00:38:50,085 --> 00:38:52,887
Ew! Ew! Old man.
Get it together.

630
00:38:53,021 --> 00:38:55,991
Eddie, you okay?
You having a heart attack?

631
00:38:56,124 --> 00:38:58,893
His whole left side is shutting
down. Eddie, look at me!

632
00:38:59,027 --> 00:39:01,628
- Yeah?
- There you go. Now you're back.

633
00:39:03,131 --> 00:39:05,166
"Weakness: switchblade."

634
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:07,669
Switchblade? Hey, that's new.

635
00:39:07,802 --> 00:39:09,838
Bravestone didn't
have weaknesses last time.

636
00:39:09,971 --> 00:39:11,706
Yeah,
bugged the hell out of me.

637
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,375
I wonder if...

638
00:39:18,179 --> 00:39:21,783
- "Nunchucks"? That's new.
- Damn, that's a good list.

639
00:39:21,916 --> 00:39:24,853
Milo, push on your left,
like, chest area.

640
00:39:24,986 --> 00:39:27,722
- I'm sorry, what?
- Come on, man.

641
00:39:27,856 --> 00:39:29,290
Hey!

642
00:39:29,424 --> 00:39:31,493
Oh, I got one too. What...?

643
00:39:31,625 --> 00:39:36,031
My. "Zoology." That's what
you were talking about earlier.

644
00:39:36,164 --> 00:39:37,332
- Yes. Exactly.
- Yes.

645
00:39:37,465 --> 00:39:39,067
Your avatar is a zoologist.

646
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:43,004
You know, my nephew Maxwell
is a veterinarian.

647
00:39:43,138 --> 00:39:45,273
- What a fascinating...
- "Linguistics"?

648
00:39:45,407 --> 00:39:48,076
- I didn't have that last time.
- The study of languages.

649
00:39:48,209 --> 00:39:50,678
Makes sense.
He studies the entire language

650
00:39:50,812 --> 00:39:52,280
on his way to the point.

651
00:39:52,414 --> 00:39:55,549
Anyway, he's 32. Or is he 35?

652
00:39:55,683 --> 00:39:56,851
Time does fly.

653
00:39:56,985 --> 00:39:58,552
Okay, let's get it over with.

654
00:40:03,024 --> 00:40:04,558
You gotta be kidding me.

655
00:40:04,692 --> 00:40:07,028
Well, geometry is...

656
00:40:07,162 --> 00:40:08,562
- Is new.
- Yeah.

657
00:40:08,696 --> 00:40:10,765
Who wouldn't wanna
be better at geometry?

658
00:40:10,899 --> 00:40:13,168
And for weaknesses,
"Endurance."

659
00:40:13,301 --> 00:40:17,105
And what else? Let's see,
"Heat, sun and sand."

660
00:40:19,974 --> 00:40:21,776
Shouldn't be a problem.
It's not like

661
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:25,046
we're in the middle of
a goddamn desert or anything.

662
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:27,749
What's the point of this guy?
Who even needs this guy?

663
00:40:27,882 --> 00:40:29,084
He can read the map.

664
00:40:29,217 --> 00:40:31,119
Easy for you to say,
you got nunchucks!

665
00:40:31,252 --> 00:40:34,456
I've been training four hours
a day for six months.

666
00:40:34,588 --> 00:40:36,357
Now look at me!

667
00:40:36,491 --> 00:40:38,960
Man, it is hot out here!

668
00:40:39,094 --> 00:40:43,832
How is this guy a character
in an adventure game?

669
00:40:43,965 --> 00:40:45,567
Okay, okay, okay.

670
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:48,602
I gotta get this guy in shape
and build up some endurance.

671
00:40:48,736 --> 00:40:49,838
I know how to do that.

672
00:40:49,971 --> 00:40:51,573
Burpees.
Five burpees, right now.

673
00:40:51,739 --> 00:40:52,974
Get it going!

674
00:40:55,977 --> 00:40:57,812
- That's one.
- One!

675
00:41:03,651 --> 00:41:05,920
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yeah, come on!

676
00:41:08,223 --> 00:41:10,592
North is that way!

677
00:41:23,605 --> 00:41:24,939
You know, it's, uh...

678
00:41:25,073 --> 00:41:27,075
It's really good
to see you, Ed.

679
00:41:27,208 --> 00:41:28,610
I don't wanna hear it.

680
00:41:28,743 --> 00:41:30,945
You don't wanna hear
that it's good to see you?

681
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:34,648
- You sold me out, Milo.
- I did not sell you out.

682
00:41:34,782 --> 00:41:36,851
We sold our business.
It was time.

683
00:41:36,985 --> 00:41:39,854
- Yeah, time for who?
- Well, it was time for me.

684
00:41:39,988 --> 00:41:41,789
Okay? Standing on my feet,

685
00:41:41,923 --> 00:41:44,292
serving a hundred plates
a night for 35 years?

686
00:41:44,425 --> 00:41:46,227
I was done.

687
00:41:46,361 --> 00:41:48,196
I was ready, man.

688
00:41:48,329 --> 00:41:50,031
I was ready to retire.

689
00:41:50,165 --> 00:41:51,399
I'm done talking!

690
00:42:06,514 --> 00:42:07,982
"The Oasis."

691
00:42:10,552 --> 00:42:12,387
I guess
that's the next level.

692
00:42:14,622 --> 00:42:15,823
Huh?

693
00:42:17,025 --> 00:42:19,127
The next level
of the game.

694
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:20,495
We're in
a game?

695
00:42:20,628 --> 00:42:22,730
Oh. Yes, Grandpa Eddie,
we are in a game.

696
00:42:22,864 --> 00:42:24,132
You can't be
serious.

697
00:42:24,265 --> 00:42:25,633
Did you know
about this?

698
00:42:25,767 --> 00:42:27,702
I thought
you were done talking.

699
00:42:39,847 --> 00:42:41,749
- Bethany?
- Yep.

700
00:42:43,051 --> 00:42:45,386
- My name's Bethany too.
- Really?

701
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,622
Daddy, her name's Bethany too.

702
00:42:52,594 --> 00:42:54,562
Sure is, sweetie.

703
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,798
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

704
00:43:00,101 --> 00:43:01,704
Sure, yeah. Uh, come in.

705
00:43:02,937 --> 00:43:03,972
I'm sorry, I just...

706
00:43:04,105 --> 00:43:05,540
I didn't know
where else to go.

707
00:43:05,674 --> 00:43:07,375
No, no, no, it's okay.

708
00:43:07,508 --> 00:43:09,077
I'm glad you came.

709
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:12,413
Do you think you can help me
get the machine to start?

710
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:17,385
That is so dangerous.

711
00:43:17,518 --> 00:43:18,620
I know.

712
00:43:20,588 --> 00:43:22,123
But I have to try.

713
00:43:24,425 --> 00:43:25,728
They're my team.

714
00:43:39,107 --> 00:43:41,376
So, what exactly
are we looking for again?

715
00:43:41,509 --> 00:43:43,378
We're looking
for my grandson, genius.

716
00:43:43,511 --> 00:43:46,781
Okay, "Follow the flame
to the desert fruit."

717
00:43:49,718 --> 00:43:50,818
Look.

718
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:53,788
They're here.

719
00:43:53,921 --> 00:43:55,490
Hyenas.

720
00:43:55,623 --> 00:43:58,293
Unusual for
their bone-crushing teeth.

721
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:04,098
Smoke Stack.

722
00:44:04,232 --> 00:44:05,867
Where's there's smoke...

723
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,102
There's fire.

724
00:44:08,236 --> 00:44:09,971
- Come on.
- Mm.

725
00:44:10,104 --> 00:44:12,640
- Boom!
- You call that a roll?

726
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:14,042
Not bad at all.

727
00:44:14,175 --> 00:44:15,510
I'll bet you two more!

728
00:44:15,643 --> 00:44:18,279
Drinks! Drinks over here!

729
00:44:18,413 --> 00:44:19,447
Another round here!

730
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:21,149
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

731
00:44:41,502 --> 00:44:43,204
I thought
you'd never come back.

732
00:44:46,007 --> 00:44:47,642
I need to talk to you.

733
00:44:50,044 --> 00:44:51,379
Absolutely.

734
00:44:52,513 --> 00:44:55,016
Not here, not now.

735
00:44:55,149 --> 00:44:56,752
Not around them.

736
00:45:02,857 --> 00:45:04,192
Leave me alone!

737
00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:10,064
Wow.

738
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:12,900
Fiery.

739
00:45:13,034 --> 00:45:15,002
Not a real person.

740
00:45:15,136 --> 00:45:17,205
- What'd she say?
- Well, she said she thought

741
00:45:17,338 --> 00:45:20,208
I was never gonna come back,
she wants to get together later,

742
00:45:20,341 --> 00:45:22,910
- and we all know what that means.
- Hiyo!

743
00:45:23,044 --> 00:45:25,012
It means that she's got
a clue for you.

744
00:45:25,146 --> 00:45:27,482
Oh, that's a coincidence.
I got a clue for her.

745
00:45:27,615 --> 00:45:29,217
- You got a clue for her.
- Wait.

746
00:45:29,350 --> 00:45:32,253
She's your ex-girlfriend.
She's the flame.

747
00:45:32,387 --> 00:45:34,155
- "Follow the flame."
- What?

748
00:45:45,566 --> 00:45:47,435
The jewel, it's here.

749
00:46:03,551 --> 00:46:05,486
Is that the guy
that killed my parents?

750
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:08,055
No. Well, yeah. Kind of.

751
00:46:10,625 --> 00:46:12,895
We lost a good man today.

752
00:46:14,395 --> 00:46:15,731
The very best of us.

753
00:46:17,632 --> 00:46:19,600
For Dagfinn...

754
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:21,936
wasn't just my hyena master.

755
00:46:23,271 --> 00:46:24,873
He was my friend.

756
00:46:25,006 --> 00:46:27,375
I loved him like a brother.

757
00:46:28,576 --> 00:46:31,612
And now he's gone.

758
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:34,415
And his beloved hyenas
are left...

759
00:46:34,549 --> 00:46:36,083
without their master.

760
00:46:40,354 --> 00:46:41,723
Long live Dagfinn.

761
00:46:41,857 --> 00:46:44,726
Long live Dagfinn!

762
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:47,128
Why did he have to die?

763
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:51,834
He died because...

764
00:46:51,966 --> 00:46:54,068
he made a mistake.

765
00:46:54,202 --> 00:46:57,605
He tried to steal something
quite precious from me.

766
00:46:59,173 --> 00:47:01,442
He left me no choice.

767
00:47:01,576 --> 00:47:03,478
And now...

768
00:47:03,611 --> 00:47:07,648
I feed him
to his beloved hyenas.

769
00:47:11,619 --> 00:47:13,354
- That's messed up.
- Oh!

770
00:47:13,488 --> 00:47:15,556
I loved Dagfinn!

771
00:47:17,358 --> 00:47:19,695
There's none among you
I love as much.

772
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:22,396
And so...

773
00:47:27,468 --> 00:47:29,036
The key!

774
00:47:30,104 --> 00:47:31,874
It's gone.

775
00:47:32,941 --> 00:47:35,109
Thief!

776
00:47:35,243 --> 00:47:37,779
I got her. I got the thief.

777
00:47:37,913 --> 00:47:39,547
Wait.

778
00:47:39,681 --> 00:47:42,016
- Are you guys...? Wha...?
- Come here.

779
00:47:42,149 --> 00:47:44,653
- Catch her!
- Don't let her get away.

780
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:50,458
Trying to steal
the key to my chest?

781
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:53,528
Nope.

782
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:54,696
Shake her down.

783
00:47:57,699 --> 00:47:59,400
I'm sorry, I did it.
It was my fault.

784
00:47:59,534 --> 00:48:01,068
I, uh...

785
00:48:02,503 --> 00:48:05,072
I just... I don't...

786
00:48:05,206 --> 00:48:08,242
I don't know what I was...
Oy vey.

787
00:48:08,376 --> 00:48:12,781
Uh, it's like, um...
It's like I'm hyperventilating.

788
00:48:12,915 --> 00:48:15,116
Does anyone have,
like, a eucalyptus inhaler?

789
00:48:15,249 --> 00:48:16,952
Or a brown paper bag?

790
00:48:17,084 --> 00:48:18,020
Spencer?

791
00:48:18,152 --> 00:48:19,520
Is it really hot in here?

792
00:48:19,655 --> 00:48:21,088
You mean...?

793
00:48:21,222 --> 00:48:23,591
- That's him. Right there.
- What?

794
00:48:23,725 --> 00:48:26,762
That ain't Spencer.
Look, I know my grandson.

795
00:48:26,895 --> 00:48:27,996
My grandson's a guy.

796
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:31,033
Did he change his hair?

797
00:48:32,199 --> 00:48:34,168
- Cut off her head.
- Yeah!

798
00:48:34,302 --> 00:48:36,237
- Cut off her head!
- Wait, wait, wait.

799
00:48:36,370 --> 00:48:39,607
I just think, uh, maybe
don't cut off my head?

800
00:48:39,741 --> 00:48:40,608
- Oh!
- Spencer!

801
00:48:40,742 --> 00:48:42,044
- Oh, my.
- Did he just...?

802
00:48:42,176 --> 00:48:43,110
Oh, Lord.

803
00:48:45,179 --> 00:48:46,414
That's my Life Alert.

804
00:48:46,547 --> 00:48:48,016
I gotta take my pill.

805
00:48:54,823 --> 00:48:56,123
Come on!

806
00:48:57,993 --> 00:48:58,961
Spencer!

807
00:48:59,093 --> 00:49:00,829
Oh, my God, you're alive.

808
00:49:00,963 --> 00:49:02,831
What are you guys doing here?

809
00:49:02,965 --> 00:49:05,667
What are we doing here?
We came to get you, fool!

810
00:49:05,801 --> 00:49:08,804
- Bethany?
- Not Bethany. Fridge, goddamn it!

811
00:49:08,937 --> 00:49:10,504
What? So, um...

812
00:49:10,638 --> 00:49:12,975
Milo Walker, darling.

813
00:49:15,043 --> 00:49:16,477
Milo?

814
00:49:18,714 --> 00:49:21,282
- Spencer? Is that you, kiddo?
- Grandpa?

815
00:49:21,415 --> 00:49:23,685
Guys, I found Spencer.
Here's Spencer right here.

816
00:49:23,819 --> 00:49:26,153
What are you stealing for?

817
00:49:26,287 --> 00:49:28,924
- I'm still me.
- Oh.

818
00:49:29,057 --> 00:49:29,992
Hey.

819
00:49:30,124 --> 00:49:32,828
- Hey.
- Hey.

820
00:49:37,365 --> 00:49:38,332
Come on.

821
00:49:42,637 --> 00:49:44,305
Let's go.

822
00:49:54,049 --> 00:49:56,818
Damn it, I was so close.
I had the key in my hand.

823
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:59,153
- Why'd you stop me?
- Huh? Someone yelled "thief,"

824
00:49:59,286 --> 00:50:00,922
so I grabbed you.
What do you want?

825
00:50:01,056 --> 00:50:03,391
You shouldn't have come.
I had it under control.

826
00:50:03,524 --> 00:50:05,961
Did you? It looked like
you just got murdered.

827
00:50:06,094 --> 00:50:08,730
I mean, what the hell, Spencer?
Why are you even here?

828
00:50:08,864 --> 00:50:10,331
Why did you have the game?

829
00:50:10,464 --> 00:50:13,802
We destroyed it
so that this would never happen!

830
00:50:13,935 --> 00:50:15,671
I went back and got it, okay?

831
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:19,007
I don't know
why I did it, but I did.

832
00:50:19,141 --> 00:50:21,810
And then last night...

833
00:50:21,943 --> 00:50:23,511
I've been in kind
of a weird place,

834
00:50:23,644 --> 00:50:25,479
and something
came over me, okay?

835
00:50:25,613 --> 00:50:27,816
And now we're all
stuck here again!

836
00:50:27,949 --> 00:50:32,620
I thought that I would be him.
Bravestone!

837
00:50:32,754 --> 00:50:34,856
I wanted to feel
like that again.

838
00:50:36,925 --> 00:50:39,828
Like... I could do anything.

839
00:50:42,296 --> 00:50:44,733
But instead, I'm, um...

840
00:50:44,866 --> 00:50:46,702
Ming Fleetfoot.

841
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:51,238
"Cat burglar,
pickpocket, safecracker."

842
00:50:51,372 --> 00:50:53,041
Another better character.

843
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:55,409
- "Weakness: pollen."
- Yeah.

844
00:50:55,543 --> 00:50:57,746
She's small and crafty
and has allergies.

845
00:50:57,879 --> 00:50:58,980
She's basically me.

846
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:02,150
I swear, man, if we survive,

847
00:51:02,283 --> 00:51:04,452
I am gonna kill you.

848
00:51:04,585 --> 00:51:07,288
I just can't believe
you came back here on purpose.

849
00:51:07,421 --> 00:51:09,356
I'm sorry. Okay?

850
00:51:11,592 --> 00:51:13,128
I'm sorry.

851
00:51:14,428 --> 00:51:15,629
Wait!

852
00:51:15,764 --> 00:51:17,199
Oh, there she is.

853
00:51:17,331 --> 00:51:19,701
- Who?
- My ex.

854
00:51:19,835 --> 00:51:21,302
Okay.

855
00:51:21,435 --> 00:51:22,704
Hi.

856
00:51:24,106 --> 00:51:26,942
If my husband knew
I was talking to you,

857
00:51:27,075 --> 00:51:29,211
you'd be dead by morning.

858
00:51:29,343 --> 00:51:31,913
Uh, don't tell him?

859
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:34,381
Listen to me,
Jurgen and his army

860
00:51:34,515 --> 00:51:36,383
are returning to his fortress.

861
00:51:36,517 --> 00:51:39,721
There, they will meet
the Brothers Kababik.

862
00:51:39,855 --> 00:51:43,290
He will trade the Falcon Jewel,
and an alliance will be formed.

863
00:51:43,424 --> 00:51:46,928
You must get the jewel
before that happens.

864
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:48,529
You're our only hope,

865
00:51:48,663 --> 00:51:50,699
so you must hurry.

866
00:51:52,768 --> 00:51:53,935
Oh, my.

867
00:51:56,772 --> 00:51:58,372
- Now you must go.
- Gotta go.

868
00:51:58,506 --> 00:51:59,908
They're gonna meet
the Brothers who?

869
00:52:00,041 --> 00:52:01,408
The Brothers Kababik.

870
00:52:01,542 --> 00:52:03,477
- The Brothers Bababik.
- Shh!

871
00:52:03,611 --> 00:52:05,914
- Kababik?
- You must get the jewel

872
00:52:06,047 --> 00:52:07,314
before that happens.

873
00:52:07,448 --> 00:52:10,852
You are our only hope,
so you must hurry.

874
00:52:18,727 --> 00:52:21,196
I think you should explain it
to us one more time.

875
00:52:21,328 --> 00:52:22,864
- Wait a second.
- Oh!

876
00:52:22,998 --> 00:52:24,331
What about the desert fruit?

877
00:52:24,465 --> 00:52:25,667
Aren't you gonna
lead us to that?

878
00:52:25,801 --> 00:52:27,669
Now I must go...

879
00:52:27,803 --> 00:52:29,971
before Switchblade
realizes I'm gone.

880
00:52:31,673 --> 00:52:33,742
What? Switchblade?

881
00:52:33,875 --> 00:52:34,843
That's his weakness.

882
00:52:36,343 --> 00:52:38,814
I love you, Dr. Bravestone.

883
00:52:40,081 --> 00:52:42,184
And I always will.

884
00:52:42,316 --> 00:52:44,119
That...

885
00:52:44,252 --> 00:52:46,320
is my curse.

886
00:52:49,891 --> 00:52:51,259
I love you too!

887
00:52:52,994 --> 00:52:55,130
Well, she seems
like a nice girl.

888
00:52:59,801 --> 00:53:01,837
We need camels.

889
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:05,372
Okay, if we're gonna catch up
with Jurgen, we need camels.

890
00:53:05,506 --> 00:53:08,710
And we need to find the desert
fruit, whatever that is.

891
00:53:08,844 --> 00:53:11,313
"Follow the flame."
I guess we have to follow her.

892
00:53:11,445 --> 00:53:13,982
You guys follow her,
we'll go steal some camels.

893
00:53:33,802 --> 00:53:35,036
Whoa.

894
00:54:01,663 --> 00:54:03,430
"Jumanji Berry Tree."

895
00:54:03,564 --> 00:54:05,432
Jumanji berry?

896
00:54:05,566 --> 00:54:08,003
That's a desert fruit?

897
00:54:08,136 --> 00:54:10,205
I guess.

898
00:54:10,338 --> 00:54:14,309
"In the moment of need,
remember the seed."

899
00:54:14,441 --> 00:54:16,378
A little bit
of Jumanji wisdom there.

900
00:54:22,017 --> 00:54:23,151
There it is.

901
00:54:28,023 --> 00:54:30,225
Milo and I will break in
and get the camels.

902
00:54:30,358 --> 00:54:33,061
Grandpa, you stay here on
lookout. Keep a low profile.

903
00:54:33,194 --> 00:54:35,462
Got it? Low profile.

904
00:54:35,596 --> 00:54:37,431
If anyone tries
to enter the livery,

905
00:54:37,564 --> 00:54:40,101
just, I don't know,
whistle or something.

906
00:54:40,235 --> 00:54:41,602
Sure thing.

907
00:54:45,907 --> 00:54:47,342
That's not when you smolder.

908
00:54:47,474 --> 00:54:49,911
It's not the moment for it.
Forget it.

909
00:54:50,045 --> 00:54:51,612
I did it.
I don't know what it was.

910
00:54:51,746 --> 00:54:53,882
Look like your stomach
is upset.

911
00:54:54,015 --> 00:54:55,649
Like you ate something bad.

912
00:54:58,253 --> 00:54:59,620
Oh, man.

913
00:54:59,754 --> 00:55:02,257
I'm sweating. I'm sweating.

914
00:55:02,390 --> 00:55:04,092
Stealing makes me
very uncomfortable,

915
00:55:04,225 --> 00:55:07,429
which is not ideal
for a burglar.

916
00:55:29,483 --> 00:55:31,853
So the fruit
is in the tree.

917
00:55:31,987 --> 00:55:33,188
But you can't get to it

918
00:55:33,321 --> 00:55:34,789
without going through
the water

919
00:55:34,923 --> 00:55:36,391
or whatever that is.

920
00:55:36,523 --> 00:55:39,361
Get boiled or eaten by piranhas
or something.

921
00:55:43,198 --> 00:55:44,631
"Follow the flame."

922
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:48,370
I think that's how we get there.

923
00:55:48,502 --> 00:55:51,638
But I don't know how
I'm supposed to make that jump.

924
00:55:51,773 --> 00:55:54,209
I mean, it's doable...

925
00:55:54,342 --> 00:55:56,711
but I don't have
my usual explosiveness.

926
00:55:57,779 --> 00:56:00,614
- Ugh!
- Wh... Ho! Yo!

927
00:56:00,749 --> 00:56:02,951
Ho, ho, ho! Wow!

928
00:56:11,926 --> 00:56:12,827
Yes!

929
00:56:16,297 --> 00:56:18,565
Martha! Ho!

930
00:56:21,635 --> 00:56:23,505
Martha!

931
00:56:23,637 --> 00:56:24,839
Oh...

932
00:56:28,642 --> 00:56:31,179
- Martha!
- Oh, it's really heavy.

933
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:35,250
Ugh! You okay?
Give me your hand.

934
00:56:35,383 --> 00:56:36,550
There you go.

935
00:56:44,659 --> 00:56:46,593
Ow. Oh...

936
00:56:49,664 --> 00:56:51,266
Wait a second.

937
00:56:51,399 --> 00:56:53,435
- What...?
- The hell, man?

938
00:56:53,567 --> 00:56:55,403
Oh, my God!

939
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:57,539
- The hell, man?
- Oh, my God.

940
00:57:00,241 --> 00:57:02,277
- Fridge?
- Yeah.

941
00:57:02,410 --> 00:57:04,179
Martha?

942
00:57:04,312 --> 00:57:05,612
Yeah.

943
00:57:11,719 --> 00:57:14,756
Hey, move along.
Nothing to see here.

944
00:57:14,889 --> 00:57:15,957
What'd you say?

945
00:57:16,091 --> 00:57:17,591
I said, keep walking, pal.

946
00:57:17,725 --> 00:57:20,295
Nothing to see here. Beat it.

947
00:57:20,428 --> 00:57:24,566
- What'd you say?
- Beat it, get out of here.

948
00:57:24,699 --> 00:57:25,967
What'd you say?

949
00:57:36,945 --> 00:57:38,079
I said, scram!

950
00:57:46,054 --> 00:57:50,125
You want a piece of me?
Yeah, come on, come on.

951
00:57:50,258 --> 00:57:52,560
What do you got?
What do you got? Come on!

952
00:57:53,795 --> 00:57:55,930
Come and get it. Yeah!

953
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:01,402
Come on, you bastards!

954
00:58:02,470 --> 00:58:05,240
Ha, wow! Ha, ha!

955
00:58:05,373 --> 00:58:07,175
Here, camel, camel.

956
00:58:08,309 --> 00:58:09,677
Come on, let's go.

957
00:58:11,412 --> 00:58:14,449
They are proud and majestic
animals, aren't they?

958
00:58:18,553 --> 00:58:20,855
Oh, you're welcome. Heh.

959
00:58:22,957 --> 00:58:26,961
Did you...? Were you
just talking to them?

960
00:58:27,095 --> 00:58:29,731
Um, press your menu.
Uh, it's right here.

961
00:58:32,433 --> 00:58:33,801
"Linguistics."

962
00:58:33,935 --> 00:58:35,570
You can talk to animals.

963
00:58:35,703 --> 00:58:36,704
Yes.

964
00:58:36,838 --> 00:58:39,240
It appears that I speak camel.

965
00:58:39,374 --> 00:58:41,009
Can you ask them to
come with us and...?

966
00:58:42,443 --> 00:58:43,745
Excuse me.

967
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:46,981
They're willing to talk.

968
00:58:47,115 --> 00:58:49,017
Uh, they wanna know
what's in it for them

969
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:51,486
and how much luggage we have.

970
00:58:51,619 --> 00:58:55,023
Will you look at me? Oh!

971
00:58:55,156 --> 00:58:57,660
I mean, what am I supposed
to do with this?

972
00:58:57,792 --> 00:58:59,227
You read the map.

973
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:01,729
I don't wanna read the map.
I'm supposed to be her.

974
00:59:01,863 --> 00:59:04,799
Instead, there's actual hair
growing out of my face!

975
00:59:04,933 --> 00:59:09,237
Sorry. All bodies are beautiful,
even this one.

976
00:59:09,370 --> 00:59:10,972
Wait a second.

977
00:59:16,277 --> 00:59:20,248
- Oh, this is amazing!
- Careful.

978
00:59:20,381 --> 00:59:21,549
Fridge...

979
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:27,288
Yo, this thing is insane!

980
00:59:27,422 --> 00:59:29,123
Be careful.
That body is not a toy.

981
00:59:29,257 --> 00:59:30,858
No, it's a machine.

982
00:59:30,992 --> 00:59:33,394
And on top of that...

983
00:59:33,528 --> 00:59:35,063
boobs.

984
00:59:35,196 --> 00:59:37,065
Touch my boobs,
and I will murder you.

985
00:59:37,198 --> 00:59:39,534
Too late. It was literally
the first thing I did.

986
00:59:39,668 --> 00:59:40,935
Ew!

987
00:59:42,770 --> 00:59:45,373
Hey, hey, don't do that.

988
00:59:45,506 --> 00:59:47,275
Let's take this berry
and go meet them.

989
00:59:47,408 --> 00:59:48,943
Relax, girl.

990
00:59:49,077 --> 00:59:51,212
I'm trying that flying
acrobat thing you did.

991
00:59:51,346 --> 00:59:52,914
- Don't. We have the berry.
- Check this out.

992
00:59:53,047 --> 00:59:54,582
- It's not necessary.
- Omaha, Omaha!

993
00:59:54,717 --> 00:59:56,284
- Hut, hut, hike!
- Wait.

994
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:01,789
Fridge, be careful! I am telling
you, that body's a weapon.

995
01:00:01,923 --> 01:00:03,291
You don't know
what it's capable of.

996
01:00:03,424 --> 01:00:04,459
This is amazing!

997
01:00:04,592 --> 01:00:06,294
That body's a loaded gun!

998
01:00:06,427 --> 01:00:09,430
Yeah! And this gun's
about to go off!

999
01:00:09,564 --> 01:00:11,299
Whoo... Oh!

1000
01:00:11,432 --> 01:00:13,201
Oh, my God!

1001
01:00:13,334 --> 01:00:14,969
Fridge!

1002
01:00:15,103 --> 01:00:16,471
- Come here.
- Ugh!

1003
01:00:16,604 --> 01:00:19,307
Oh, my God.
Goddamn it!

1004
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:21,710
- Here, I got you. I got ya.
- Ugh!

1005
01:00:33,321 --> 01:00:36,157
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no!

1006
01:00:36,291 --> 01:00:38,359
Oh, my God, that was awful.

1007
01:00:38,493 --> 01:00:40,428
I hate being the map guy!

1008
01:00:43,631 --> 01:00:45,099
Let's get out of here.

1009
01:00:50,972 --> 01:00:53,107
Switchblade! There he is.

1010
01:00:54,542 --> 01:00:55,843
Bravestone!

1011
01:00:55,977 --> 01:00:58,346
I told you to stay
the hell away from my wife!

1012
01:01:02,383 --> 01:01:05,654
- We got company.
- What did you do?

1013
01:01:05,788 --> 01:01:08,323
All right, guys, this is
the moment. We need you now.

1014
01:01:11,826 --> 01:01:15,997
Uh, they said that we can
get away out the back door.

1015
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:18,933
- Are you talking to that camel?
- Yes.

1016
01:01:19,067 --> 01:01:20,803
That's Lucille and Hank.

1017
01:01:20,935 --> 01:01:22,603
And Jeffrey's in the back.

1018
01:01:30,311 --> 01:01:31,913
- Hey!
- Hey.

1019
01:01:34,482 --> 01:01:36,250
- We should get going.
- What happened?

1020
01:01:36,384 --> 01:01:38,052
My grandpa beat up
45 strangers.

1021
01:01:38,186 --> 01:01:40,188
That woman's husband
is trying to kill him.

1022
01:01:40,321 --> 01:01:41,657
Mm.

1023
01:01:41,790 --> 01:01:43,191
Is that the desert fruit?

1024
01:01:43,324 --> 01:01:44,827
Yeah. It's a Jumanji berry,

1025
01:01:44,959 --> 01:01:47,161
and it weighs like 100 pounds.

1026
01:01:47,295 --> 01:01:48,396
My grandpa will carry it.

1027
01:01:51,734 --> 01:01:52,934
We should get out of here.

1028
01:01:53,067 --> 01:01:54,902
Come on, Grandpa.
Let's go.

1029
01:01:55,036 --> 01:01:56,739
- I could take them.
- What?

1030
01:01:56,871 --> 01:01:58,072
What? We escaped.

1031
01:01:58,206 --> 01:02:00,508
- I said, I could take them.
- Oh, Eddie.

1032
01:02:00,641 --> 01:02:02,643
No, Grandpa Eddie,
that's Switchblade!

1033
01:02:02,778 --> 01:02:04,847
I'm telling you,
there's a time when you run.

1034
01:02:04,979 --> 01:02:07,248
Then there's a time in life,
like now, where you stay...

1035
01:02:13,054 --> 01:02:15,691
Yeah! Yeah!

1036
01:02:15,824 --> 01:02:17,091
<i>Switchblade! Switchblade!</i>

1037
01:02:17,225 --> 01:02:18,893
Nice shot, Switchblade!

1038
01:02:27,168 --> 01:02:28,236
- Oh!
- Phew.

1039
01:02:36,010 --> 01:02:36,944
What?

1040
01:02:50,124 --> 01:02:52,661
We should see
Mount Zhatmire pretty soon.

1041
01:02:55,096 --> 01:02:58,933
You know, Gladys and I took
a road trip before she passed.

1042
01:02:59,066 --> 01:03:01,402
We went on a ceramics tour

1043
01:03:01,536 --> 01:03:03,037
through the Southwest.

1044
01:03:03,171 --> 01:03:05,640
I lost my restaurant
so you could drive around

1045
01:03:05,774 --> 01:03:07,876
- and look at ashtrays?
- Yes, Ed.

1046
01:03:08,042 --> 01:03:10,411
That's what you do
when you retire.

1047
01:03:10,545 --> 01:03:12,781
You explore your interests.

1048
01:03:12,915 --> 01:03:14,549
I don't have interests.

1049
01:03:14,683 --> 01:03:17,318
Guys like me, we don't retire!

1050
01:03:17,452 --> 01:03:19,454
We work,
and then we keep working,

1051
01:03:19,587 --> 01:03:21,289
and then, eventually, we die.

1052
01:03:21,422 --> 01:03:24,292
But you retired me.
You retired me.

1053
01:03:24,425 --> 01:03:26,829
It's a wonder I lasted
as long as I did.

1054
01:03:26,961 --> 01:03:29,063
- What?
- You're a difficult man, Ed.

1055
01:03:29,197 --> 01:03:31,299
You don't abandon
your best friend, Milo.

1056
01:03:31,432 --> 01:03:34,870
When I lost the restaurant,
I lost everything!

1057
01:03:35,002 --> 01:03:36,037
You...?

1058
01:03:37,238 --> 01:03:39,106
Yes. Yes, I know he is.

1059
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:42,343
- Are you talking to my camel?
- Yes, I'm talking to the camel.

1060
01:03:42,477 --> 01:03:45,948
And he can tell
that you're a pain in the ass.

1061
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:48,382
My camel's taking your side?

1062
01:03:49,918 --> 01:03:51,954
And he's not your camel.

1063
01:03:52,086 --> 01:03:54,021
He's just giving you a ride.

1064
01:03:54,155 --> 01:03:58,125
Oh! Well, how about the both
of you go screw yourselves?

1065
01:03:58,259 --> 01:04:00,328
- What did you just say?
- Guys!

1066
01:04:00,461 --> 01:04:03,765
You and me, we gonna settle
this right here, right now!

1067
01:04:05,333 --> 01:04:07,001
- I'll show you.
- What are you doing?

1068
01:04:07,134 --> 01:04:10,037
- Don't worry about it.
- Milo, what are you doing?

1069
01:04:10,171 --> 01:04:12,774
Hold on. Wait, wait.
Here we go.

1070
01:04:16,979 --> 01:04:20,448
You want a piece of me, huh?
That's what you want?

1071
01:04:20,581 --> 01:04:23,117
You do not want a piece of him,
Milo, I'm telling you.

1072
01:04:23,251 --> 01:04:25,620
Oh, that's where
you're wrong, young man.

1073
01:04:25,754 --> 01:04:27,789
'Cause I do want a piece.

1074
01:04:27,923 --> 01:04:29,992
I want a big piece.

1075
01:04:30,124 --> 01:04:35,162
See, Eddie, what you don't know
is that for the last 15 years,

1076
01:04:35,296 --> 01:04:37,598
I've been studying tai chi.

1077
01:04:37,733 --> 01:04:39,100
And right now,

1078
01:04:39,233 --> 01:04:41,502
I am harnessing my chi.

1079
01:04:41,636 --> 01:04:44,706
And when I'm done,
I'm gonna whup your ass.

1080
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:47,843
Milo, I am telling you,
this is not a good idea.

1081
01:04:52,146 --> 01:04:53,581
No!

1082
01:04:59,554 --> 01:05:02,089
Oh, dude!

1083
01:05:02,223 --> 01:05:04,392
You gotta stop
killing everybody.

1084
01:05:12,466 --> 01:05:14,036
All right, then.

1085
01:05:14,168 --> 01:05:16,905
Well, I guess that's settled.

1086
01:05:29,483 --> 01:05:31,352
The camels just stopped.

1087
01:05:35,189 --> 01:05:37,224
This is as far as they go.

1088
01:05:37,358 --> 01:05:39,661
To get to Jurgen's fortress,
they said that we can

1089
01:05:39,795 --> 01:05:42,263
head down this path here
and make a right.

1090
01:05:42,396 --> 01:05:43,899
Then we're in his territory.

1091
01:05:44,032 --> 01:05:45,399
And they don't wanna
go there

1092
01:05:45,533 --> 01:05:48,469
because they
don't want to die.

1093
01:05:48,603 --> 01:05:50,672
We don't wanna die either.

1094
01:05:55,543 --> 01:05:58,013
He's the worst Bravestone
of all time.

1095
01:06:32,781 --> 01:06:35,449
So we have to get
across... this.

1096
01:06:39,021 --> 01:06:41,723
Okay, we can do this.
We can do this.

1097
01:06:41,857 --> 01:06:44,191
We have to take our time,
make careful decisions.

1098
01:06:44,325 --> 01:06:46,193
What are you talking about?
It's obvious.

1099
01:06:46,327 --> 01:06:47,696
We start on that bridge there,

1100
01:06:47,829 --> 01:06:50,032
then jump to that one
that heads to the right,

1101
01:06:50,164 --> 01:06:52,668
and then those look
like two sides of a trapezoid...

1102
01:06:54,036 --> 01:06:57,471
Geometry.
That's what it's for!

1103
01:06:57,605 --> 01:06:59,808
Maybe this character's
not totally worthless.

1104
01:07:01,143 --> 01:07:02,911
- I'll go first.
- Really?

1105
01:07:08,016 --> 01:07:09,785
You see? It's no big deal.

1106
01:07:11,820 --> 01:07:12,988
Oh.
What's going on?

1107
01:07:13,121 --> 01:07:15,023
- Oh, no, no, no.
- Oh, no.

1108
01:07:17,659 --> 01:07:18,860
- No.
- Grandpa!

1109
01:07:22,530 --> 01:07:23,965
Ah, crap.

1110
01:07:25,366 --> 01:07:26,500
Ah, geez.

1111
01:07:28,136 --> 01:07:29,637
What the hell?

1112
01:07:33,041 --> 01:07:35,077
- It's okay. We can do this.
- Yeah?

1113
01:07:35,242 --> 01:07:36,912
It's about finding
the right timing.

1114
01:07:37,045 --> 01:07:38,814
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Follow me.

1115
01:07:43,985 --> 01:07:45,721
Come on!

1116
01:07:45,854 --> 01:07:47,555
Come on, Milo, come on!

1117
01:07:49,691 --> 01:07:52,794
Ah! Whoa! Whoa!

1118
01:07:52,928 --> 01:07:54,963
- Oh! Oh, Lord.
- Here.

1119
01:07:55,097 --> 01:07:56,597
Oh, okay.

1120
01:08:02,369 --> 01:08:03,604
Hey, you guys.

1121
01:08:03,739 --> 01:08:05,774
Is that rock... moving?

1122
01:08:11,179 --> 01:08:13,347
- Oh, no.
- What?

1123
01:08:13,481 --> 01:08:15,684
Well, now, this is a problem.

1124
01:08:15,817 --> 01:08:17,953
- Come on, what is it?
- Oh, my.

1125
01:08:18,086 --> 01:08:20,122
- Spit it out!
- What is it?

1126
01:08:20,254 --> 01:08:23,257
- Tell us!
- Tell us! Milo!

1127
01:08:27,696 --> 01:08:29,363
Those are mandrills.

1128
01:08:29,497 --> 01:08:31,632
- We should go. Go, go!
- Go!

1129
01:08:35,737 --> 01:08:37,773
That one! Obtuse angle!

1130
01:08:39,875 --> 01:08:41,943
Note the distinctive
and colorful pigment

1131
01:08:42,077 --> 01:08:44,079
around their face and buttocks.

1132
01:08:47,816 --> 01:08:50,484
Mandrills are the heaviest
of all monkeys.

1133
01:08:50,618 --> 01:08:54,990
Even heavier than baboons, with
which they are often confused.

1134
01:08:57,659 --> 01:08:59,460
And now head for the rhombus!

1135
01:08:59,593 --> 01:09:01,529
Come on. Hurry up.

1136
01:09:01,663 --> 01:09:02,931
- Rhombus! Rhombus!
- Come on.

1137
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:13,775
No, Martha!

1138
01:09:13,909 --> 01:09:15,911
- You're on the wrong bridge!
- What?

1139
01:09:16,044 --> 01:09:17,478
The perpendicular one!

1140
01:09:24,753 --> 01:09:25,921
Martha!

1141
01:09:32,294 --> 01:09:33,261
Martha!

1142
01:09:36,463 --> 01:09:38,200
No!

1143
01:09:38,332 --> 01:09:41,303
No!

1144
01:09:41,435 --> 01:09:43,805
Spencer, behind you!

1145
01:09:46,141 --> 01:09:47,809
Jump!

1146
01:09:47,943 --> 01:09:50,245
Come on, I got you!

1147
01:09:51,713 --> 01:09:53,882
Spencer!

1148
01:10:01,555 --> 01:10:02,891
Oh, no! Ow! Ow!

1149
01:10:13,134 --> 01:10:15,436
Oh, no! No! Ow! Ow!

1150
01:10:15,569 --> 01:10:16,604
Get off!

1151
01:10:23,377 --> 01:10:25,146
Come on.

1152
01:10:30,151 --> 01:10:31,887
All right, bring it on.

1153
01:10:34,055 --> 01:10:36,992
Come on, come here. Ha, ha!

1154
01:10:39,027 --> 01:10:40,494
- Grandpa!
- Ow!

1155
01:10:40,628 --> 01:10:42,664
Grandpa! Enough!

1156
01:10:42,797 --> 01:10:44,199
- Grandpa, stop!
- Yeah!

1157
01:10:44,332 --> 01:10:45,200
They're gone!

1158
01:10:47,635 --> 01:10:49,204
- Whoa!
- Yeah!

1159
01:10:56,778 --> 01:10:58,146
Come on!

1160
01:11:04,052 --> 01:11:05,220
Give me your hand!

1161
01:11:05,353 --> 01:11:06,755
- What?
- Trust me!

1162
01:11:27,909 --> 01:11:29,311
Oh! Go.

1163
01:11:30,946 --> 01:11:33,782
Last one. Aim for
the center of the parabola!

1164
01:11:36,885 --> 01:11:40,055
Oh, damn. Ugh! Son of a...

1165
01:11:41,790 --> 01:11:43,425
Ow!

1166
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:48,396
Oh! Oh! Oh!

1167
01:11:48,529 --> 01:11:50,665
- Eddie?
- Milo!

1168
01:11:50,799 --> 01:11:53,368
Eddie!
Hey, Eddie, where you going?

1169
01:11:54,501 --> 01:11:56,004
I need your help, Eddie.

1170
01:11:58,440 --> 01:11:59,606
Eddie!

1171
01:12:01,810 --> 01:12:02,777
Oh!

1172
01:12:05,413 --> 01:12:09,818
- Oh!
- Ugh.

1173
01:12:12,354 --> 01:12:14,389
Eddie! Milo!

1174
01:12:21,763 --> 01:12:23,131
Oh!

1175
01:12:35,810 --> 01:12:37,846
- Seriously?
- Later.

1176
01:12:39,247 --> 01:12:40,614
- Run!
- Run!

1177
01:12:58,632 --> 01:12:59,868
Hyah!

1178
01:13:14,716 --> 01:13:16,384
Hey, guys.

1179
01:13:16,518 --> 01:13:17,752
Who the hell's this?

1180
01:13:17,886 --> 01:13:20,188
Alex, what are you doing here?

1181
01:13:20,321 --> 01:13:22,390
Bethany thought
you might need some help.

1182
01:13:22,524 --> 01:13:24,993
- Where is Bethany?
- She's right here.

1183
01:13:26,027 --> 01:13:27,162
You mean...?

1184
01:13:33,401 --> 01:13:35,602
"Oh, my God, right?

1185
01:13:35,737 --> 01:13:38,073
Like, I'm a total horse.

1186
01:13:38,206 --> 01:13:41,042
I can't believe
that we found you guys.

1187
01:13:41,176 --> 01:13:42,877
Hi."

1188
01:13:43,011 --> 01:13:45,847
Yep, that's Bethany.
Ha-ha-ha. What's up, girl?

1189
01:13:45,980 --> 01:13:47,048
Hey.

1190
01:13:47,182 --> 01:13:49,017
Oh, we brought you
some clothes.

1191
01:13:49,150 --> 01:13:50,418
You must be freezing.

1192
01:13:55,790 --> 01:13:59,294
So, uh, this horse
is a character in the game?

1193
01:13:59,427 --> 01:14:01,329
Yeah. Cyclone's his name.

1194
01:14:03,898 --> 01:14:05,433
- How's that feel?
- I don't know.

1195
01:14:05,567 --> 01:14:07,435
I sprained it pretty good.

1196
01:14:07,569 --> 01:14:08,970
Where'd you get these clothes?

1197
01:14:09,104 --> 01:14:11,172
When I realized how far
north we were going,

1198
01:14:11,306 --> 01:14:12,941
- we stopped to go shopping.
- Ah.

1199
01:14:13,074 --> 01:14:15,110
You can shop here?
How did you know that?

1200
01:14:15,243 --> 01:14:17,445
I was here for 20 years, kiddo.

1201
01:14:17,579 --> 01:14:19,514
At least I got rid
of that stupid hat.

1202
01:14:19,646 --> 01:14:21,416
Now I got this stupid hat.

1203
01:14:37,699 --> 01:14:39,300
It's something,
isn't it?

1204
01:14:40,768 --> 01:14:42,403
Yeah,
it's something.

1205
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:47,475
You know, Eddie...

1206
01:14:47,609 --> 01:14:52,313
you didn't lose everything
when you lost the restaurant.

1207
01:14:52,447 --> 01:14:54,249
You still got a lot, man.

1208
01:14:58,953 --> 01:15:00,221
I lost my friend.

1209
01:15:03,324 --> 01:15:04,559
So did I.

1210
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:20,008
I'm sorry, Milo.

1211
01:15:27,215 --> 01:15:30,051
Hey, I'm sorry too, Eddie.

1212
01:15:30,185 --> 01:15:32,655
I should have tracked you down
a long time ago.

1213
01:15:34,923 --> 01:15:37,458
I'm glad you came over
for coffee.

1214
01:15:40,828 --> 01:15:42,697
What made you do it, huh?

1215
01:15:44,465 --> 01:15:46,034
I mean, why now?

1216
01:15:49,204 --> 01:15:50,505
Milo, what's going on?

1217
01:15:56,544 --> 01:15:57,680
You're sick.

1218
01:16:02,016 --> 01:16:03,017
How bad?

1219
01:16:04,919 --> 01:16:06,854
I don't have much time left.

1220
01:16:10,024 --> 01:16:12,227
Son of a bitch.

1221
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:14,929
But I count myself lucky,
Eddie.

1222
01:16:15,063 --> 01:16:18,032
I was married
to a wonderful woman.

1223
01:16:18,166 --> 01:16:20,868
I got to live a wonderful life.

1224
01:16:21,002 --> 01:16:23,538
And not everybody
can say that.

1225
01:16:23,672 --> 01:16:26,908
That's why I wanted
to make things better with you.

1226
01:16:27,041 --> 01:16:29,377
And now that they are...

1227
01:16:29,510 --> 01:16:31,546
well, I'm...

1228
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:33,348
I'm happy about that too.

1229
01:16:47,362 --> 01:16:50,898
Grandpa, Milo.
Come on, we gotta go.

1230
01:16:58,006 --> 01:16:59,374
"The Fortress."

1231
01:16:59,507 --> 01:17:01,609
Looks like
the last level.

1232
01:17:01,744 --> 01:17:04,078
Okay, so we, uh,
climb that mountain

1233
01:17:04,212 --> 01:17:05,513
and then we sneak in somehow.

1234
01:17:05,647 --> 01:17:07,148
Yeah,
and then we steal the jewel

1235
01:17:07,282 --> 01:17:09,017
before the Brothers Kababik
get there.

1236
01:17:09,150 --> 01:17:11,853
- And then show it to the sun?
- Sounds like a plan.

1237
01:17:11,986 --> 01:17:13,588
What?

1238
01:17:13,722 --> 01:17:17,025
I'm sorry, I think I missed
the "plan" part of the plan.

1239
01:17:17,158 --> 01:17:20,361
That last level almost killed
us all. I can barely walk.

1240
01:17:20,495 --> 01:17:22,765
Your grandpa beats the hell
out of the wrong guy

1241
01:17:22,897 --> 01:17:25,768
or we get attacked by a bear,
what am I supposed to do?

1242
01:17:25,900 --> 01:17:27,368
I'm not gonna beat up
the wrong guy.

1243
01:17:27,502 --> 01:17:29,170
You are gonna beat up
the wrong guy!

1244
01:17:29,304 --> 01:17:30,972
You're not a good Bravestone!

1245
01:17:31,105 --> 01:17:32,675
You're too stubborn
and pissed off.

1246
01:17:32,807 --> 01:17:34,175
You keep getting us killed.

1247
01:17:34,309 --> 01:17:35,877
What the hell
you talking about?

1248
01:17:36,010 --> 01:17:37,512
And Milo...

1249
01:17:37,645 --> 01:17:39,614
And I say this
with all due respect, sir.

1250
01:17:39,748 --> 01:17:42,016
...is not a good person
to be the zoologist.

1251
01:17:42,150 --> 01:17:44,218
He talks too slow,
and by the time

1252
01:17:44,352 --> 01:17:45,987
he gets to the point,
you're dead!

1253
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:47,455
Once again, no offense.

1254
01:17:47,588 --> 01:17:48,456
None taken.

1255
01:17:48,589 --> 01:17:50,158
And let me tell you why.

1256
01:17:50,291 --> 01:17:53,027
- Because my friend Bernard...
- You see?

1257
01:17:53,161 --> 01:17:55,229
You're a thief who's
too neurotic to steal,

1258
01:17:55,363 --> 01:17:57,031
Bethany's a horse...

1259
01:17:58,767 --> 01:18:01,035
All I know is,
we are stuck here again,

1260
01:18:01,169 --> 01:18:05,273
we are running out of lives,
and my ankle is killing me! Ahh!

1261
01:18:05,406 --> 01:18:07,275
- Oh, my God!
- Fridge!

1262
01:18:07,408 --> 01:18:09,644
Fridge! Are you okay?

1263
01:18:10,945 --> 01:18:13,314
Yo, you guys gotta see this!

1264
01:18:26,527 --> 01:18:29,464
That's what the water
looked like at the tree.

1265
01:18:29,597 --> 01:18:30,865
When we...

1266
01:18:30,998 --> 01:18:32,967
Switched bodies.

1267
01:19:14,609 --> 01:19:16,812
- Goddamn, that is cold!
- Oh!

1268
01:19:16,944 --> 01:19:20,883
Oh! Oh, man! It's freezing!

1269
01:19:21,015 --> 01:19:22,150
What the hell, man?

1270
01:19:24,085 --> 01:19:25,453
Yes!

1271
01:19:25,586 --> 01:19:26,822
I missed you so much.

1272
01:19:26,954 --> 01:19:28,824
Oh, my God, you guys, hi.

1273
01:19:28,956 --> 01:19:31,660
Ahem, Spencer?

1274
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:35,096
- Hey.
- Hey.

1275
01:19:38,966 --> 01:19:41,269
- Grandpa?
- Yeah, what?

1276
01:19:43,705 --> 01:19:44,572
Milo?

1277
01:19:47,542 --> 01:19:49,010
You should see
the size of your...

1278
01:19:49,143 --> 01:19:52,280
Phew. Damn.

1279
01:19:52,413 --> 01:19:54,449
I never thought I'd be
this happy to shrink.

1280
01:19:55,616 --> 01:19:56,819
I have never seen anything

1281
01:19:56,951 --> 01:19:58,019
quite like that before.

1282
01:19:58,152 --> 01:19:59,487
Oh, my God, it's so good

1283
01:19:59,620 --> 01:20:01,824
to be able to talk again
with words.

1284
01:20:01,956 --> 01:20:04,625
- Spencer, hi!
- Hey, Bethany.

1285
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:06,294
We have so much
catching up to do.

1286
01:20:06,427 --> 01:20:07,796
I wanna hear about New York.

1287
01:20:07,930 --> 01:20:10,899
But it feels like this
isn't the perfect moment.

1288
01:20:11,032 --> 01:20:13,067
Right. Like, later.

1289
01:20:13,201 --> 01:20:14,335
Later.

1290
01:20:15,970 --> 01:20:18,774
- Better?
- Yeah.

1291
01:20:18,907 --> 01:20:20,441
Much.

1292
01:20:24,579 --> 01:20:26,748
I got hair! Heh, heh!

1293
01:20:26,882 --> 01:20:29,651
For the first time in 40 years.
I gotta go tell Milo.

1294
01:20:29,785 --> 01:20:31,820
- Be careful out there, Grandpa.
- Yeah.

1295
01:20:31,954 --> 01:20:33,321
- How's your ankle?
- Hm?

1296
01:20:33,454 --> 01:20:35,356
- Your ankle.
- It's a little sore.

1297
01:20:35,490 --> 01:20:37,425
Not as bad
as you were making it seem.

1298
01:20:37,558 --> 01:20:39,293
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

1299
01:20:39,427 --> 01:20:42,163
You were making a big deal
of it. It's not that bad.

1300
01:20:48,102 --> 01:20:50,004
Hey! Get the hell away
from that horse!

1301
01:20:50,137 --> 01:20:51,639
Freeze!

1302
01:20:51,773 --> 01:20:53,307
Milo! Hey!

1303
01:20:53,441 --> 01:20:54,943
Wait, which ankle was it?

1304
01:20:55,076 --> 01:20:56,244
- Hold it.
- Hey, hey, hey.

1305
01:20:56,377 --> 01:20:57,846
Get your hands off of me!

1306
01:20:57,980 --> 01:21:00,147
Hey! I'm with you, Milo.

1307
01:21:00,281 --> 01:21:01,482
I'm right here.

1308
01:21:05,419 --> 01:21:06,889
Guys, guys.

1309
01:21:07,956 --> 01:21:09,457
Eddie and Milo.

1310
01:21:09,590 --> 01:21:10,525
They got them.

1311
01:21:17,966 --> 01:21:19,534
There's ice everywhere,

1312
01:21:19,668 --> 01:21:21,904
and there's only one road in.

1313
01:21:22,036 --> 01:21:25,506
It's covered with guards.
I don't know how we'll get in.

1314
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:27,508
Hm. Whoa!

1315
01:21:27,642 --> 01:21:30,278
Oh, okay. I see a dungeon

1316
01:21:30,411 --> 01:21:31,747
at the top of this ice wall.

1317
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:34,115
That must be where
they're keeping your grandpa.

1318
01:21:34,248 --> 01:21:36,718
And Milo is probably
in this, like, barn thing

1319
01:21:36,852 --> 01:21:38,854
all the way
on the other side of the place.

1320
01:21:38,987 --> 01:21:41,088
Okay. We gotta split up.

1321
01:21:41,222 --> 01:21:43,792
One team goes to get Milo,
the other busts out Grandpa.

1322
01:21:43,926 --> 01:21:45,861
But how do we get in?

1323
01:21:45,994 --> 01:21:47,361
Fridge, do you have

1324
01:21:47,495 --> 01:21:50,032
any ice-climbing equipment
in your backpack?

1325
01:21:52,099 --> 01:21:54,068
You mean something like this?

1326
01:21:54,201 --> 01:21:56,738
- Just like that.
- See?

1327
01:21:56,872 --> 01:21:58,941
That's why
I'm the backpack guy.

1328
01:21:59,073 --> 01:22:00,909
- That's why.
- Yeah. You're great at that.

1329
01:22:01,043 --> 01:22:02,577
Yeah, I know.

1330
01:22:02,711 --> 01:22:05,413
Martha,
will you come with me?

1331
01:22:05,546 --> 01:22:07,248
Of course.

1332
01:22:17,391 --> 01:22:20,294
I forgot
what this part feels like.

1333
01:22:20,428 --> 01:22:22,129
It's scary.

1334
01:22:23,331 --> 01:22:25,566
- Yeah.
- Hey.

1335
01:22:25,701 --> 01:22:28,536
We can do it.
This team can do anything.

1336
01:22:30,104 --> 01:22:31,606
Nobody knows that
better than me.

1337
01:22:31,740 --> 01:22:35,376
- Yeah.
- Come on, you guys.

1338
01:22:35,509 --> 01:22:36,712
Bring it in.

1339
01:22:40,581 --> 01:22:42,116
<i>Be aggressive.</i>

1340
01:22:42,249 --> 01:22:43,652
<i>Be, be aggressive.</i>

1341
01:22:43,785 --> 01:22:45,087
<i>Be aggressive.</i>

1342
01:22:45,219 --> 01:22:47,588
<i>Be, be aggressive.</i>
Come on, guys.

1343
01:22:47,723 --> 01:22:49,557
That's not what
I thought this was. No.

1344
01:22:49,691 --> 01:22:50,625
We should just go.

1345
01:22:50,759 --> 01:22:53,160
Okay, just... Go, team.

1346
01:23:08,944 --> 01:23:09,978
Okay.

1347
01:23:10,112 --> 01:23:11,847
I'm gonna try
to sneak in with them.

1348
01:23:11,980 --> 01:23:14,916
In this outfit, I might be able
to pass. You guys stay here...

1349
01:23:15,050 --> 01:23:16,718
What? No way.

1350
01:23:16,852 --> 01:23:18,219
Now's the moment. Stay here.

1351
01:23:18,352 --> 01:23:20,689
- Alex, no!
- Go. Good luck, Alex.

1352
01:23:23,859 --> 01:23:25,159
Come on.

1353
01:23:25,292 --> 01:23:27,495
What are you talking about,
"Come on"? Bethany.

1354
01:23:27,628 --> 01:23:28,797
Bethany!

1355
01:23:32,266 --> 01:23:34,136
Turn right.

1356
01:23:50,686 --> 01:23:53,187
You there. Stay where you are.

1357
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:54,656
Who, us?

1358
01:23:54,790 --> 01:23:57,693
Are you the Brothers Kababik?

1359
01:23:57,826 --> 01:24:01,495
- Are we the who?
- Are you the Brothers Kababik?

1360
01:24:01,629 --> 01:24:03,230
Yes.

1361
01:24:03,364 --> 01:24:05,566
We are them. It is we. Us.

1362
01:24:05,701 --> 01:24:09,603
We are the Brothers Cadabra...
Kadabrik.

1363
01:24:09,738 --> 01:24:11,572
He is one brother,

1364
01:24:11,707 --> 01:24:15,376
and I am the other brother.

1365
01:24:15,509 --> 01:24:18,446
We... We got different mothers.

1366
01:24:18,579 --> 01:24:22,884
But we, uh... We came to get
the thing that we came to get.

1367
01:24:25,352 --> 01:24:26,655
Brothers Kababik,

1368
01:24:26,788 --> 01:24:28,556
on behalf of Jurgen the Brutal,

1369
01:24:28,690 --> 01:24:30,992
welcome to Zhatmire Stronghold.

1370
01:24:31,126 --> 01:24:33,028
Ah, thank you.

1371
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:54,883
There's something
I have to ask you.

1372
01:24:55,016 --> 01:24:56,383
Okay.

1373
01:24:56,517 --> 01:24:59,353
Why didn't you come visit
when you were supposed to?

1374
01:24:59,487 --> 01:25:01,189
You canceled the first time,

1375
01:25:01,322 --> 01:25:04,025
then you were gonna come
for Halloween. You cancel again.

1376
01:25:04,159 --> 01:25:05,727
Then the next time
I hear from you,

1377
01:25:05,861 --> 01:25:07,729
you tell me
we should take a break?

1378
01:25:11,066 --> 01:25:14,236
It's just... I saw all
your pictures on Instagram,

1379
01:25:14,368 --> 01:25:17,271
and you looked like you
were having so much fun, and...

1380
01:25:17,404 --> 01:25:20,842
I just got really insecure
or something.

1381
01:25:20,976 --> 01:25:24,212
Like I wasn't the guy
I thought I was.

1382
01:25:24,345 --> 01:25:26,982
Or I wasn't the guy
you thought I was.

1383
01:25:27,115 --> 01:25:29,416
Which would be even worse.

1384
01:25:29,550 --> 01:25:32,754
Spencer,
do you think I'm not...

1385
01:25:32,888 --> 01:25:35,791
totally terrified
all the time?

1386
01:25:35,924 --> 01:25:37,793
I got to school,
and suddenly,

1387
01:25:37,926 --> 01:25:41,863
for the first time ever,
people really liked me.

1388
01:25:41,997 --> 01:25:43,965
But I'm always thinking that...

1389
01:25:44,099 --> 01:25:46,300
I don't know, like it's...

1390
01:25:46,433 --> 01:25:47,936
Like it's just a matter of time

1391
01:25:48,069 --> 01:25:51,139
before somebody figures out
who I really am.

1392
01:25:51,273 --> 01:25:52,506
But then I see you.

1393
01:25:54,575 --> 01:25:57,378
And you're the person
who makes me feel good...

1394
01:25:57,511 --> 01:25:58,980
about who I really am.

1395
01:26:00,347 --> 01:26:03,551
When you're, like,
scared and insecure,

1396
01:26:03,685 --> 01:26:06,520
that's when you need
your people the most.

1397
01:26:17,598 --> 01:26:18,499
Hey, Mr. Walker.

1398
01:26:20,334 --> 01:26:21,870
Why the long face?

1399
01:26:24,005 --> 01:26:26,607
Dad joke. Sorry.
Can't help it.

1400
01:26:28,243 --> 01:26:31,046
Let's get you out of here.

1401
01:26:59,373 --> 01:27:00,574
Okay.

1402
01:27:00,709 --> 01:27:03,044
It's just an obstacle course.

1403
01:27:03,178 --> 01:27:04,746
You were good at those.

1404
01:27:20,494 --> 01:27:22,998
All right,
all right, get a room.

1405
01:27:26,835 --> 01:27:29,570
Grandpa...
let's get you out of there.

1406
01:27:29,704 --> 01:27:31,740
Here.

1407
01:27:31,873 --> 01:27:34,709
- Unh!
- Whoa.

1408
01:27:34,843 --> 01:27:36,711
Let's blow this joint, huh?

1409
01:27:36,845 --> 01:27:38,612
We still have
to find the jewel.

1410
01:27:38,747 --> 01:27:41,216
It must be in a vault
or treasure room or something.

1411
01:27:41,349 --> 01:27:43,318
Yeah, that's how
it works in these games.

1412
01:27:43,450 --> 01:27:45,486
I passed a vault
on the way up to this dump.

1413
01:27:45,619 --> 01:27:47,923
Single access,
3-foot-thick steel door.

1414
01:27:48,056 --> 01:27:50,591
Only way in is through
a grate in the ceiling.

1415
01:27:58,967 --> 01:28:02,436
Hoo... Oh. Huh.

1416
01:28:02,569 --> 01:28:04,272
I think I got it now.

1417
01:28:06,607 --> 01:28:09,443
Just stay on...

1418
01:28:09,576 --> 01:28:10,779
the raised ones.

1419
01:28:33,902 --> 01:28:36,338
Jurgen the Brutal awaits.

1420
01:28:38,605 --> 01:28:42,643
So, tell me,
which brother is which?

1421
01:28:45,146 --> 01:28:47,115
Um, how do you mean?

1422
01:28:47,248 --> 01:28:50,118
Which brother is which?

1423
01:28:50,251 --> 01:28:53,487
Which of you is Augustus
and which is Tomatoli?

1424
01:28:54,990 --> 01:28:58,760
Um... I am Augustus.

1425
01:29:00,061 --> 01:29:02,030
And I'm Tomatolik.

1426
01:29:03,398 --> 01:29:06,167
Augustus Kababik.

1427
01:29:06,301 --> 01:29:08,502
The cleverest man
in all of Jumanji.

1428
01:29:10,071 --> 01:29:11,973
Yes, I'm totally that man.

1429
01:29:12,107 --> 01:29:14,843
- And Tomatoli Kababik.
- That's me.

1430
01:29:14,976 --> 01:29:17,445
The bravest eunuch.

1431
01:29:17,611 --> 01:29:20,682
- Wait a minute, what?
- Did you say, "Eunuch"?

1432
01:29:20,815 --> 01:29:23,485
Tomatoli Kababik,
everyone knows the tale

1433
01:29:23,617 --> 01:29:26,121
of your great
and generous sacrifice.

1434
01:29:26,254 --> 01:29:28,356
How you gave your testicles

1435
01:29:28,490 --> 01:29:31,326
in order to save the region
from the floods.

1436
01:29:31,459 --> 01:29:32,861
There might be
a little confusion.

1437
01:29:32,994 --> 01:29:34,595
Of course.
Everybody knows the story

1438
01:29:34,729 --> 01:29:38,166
about my little brother
and his famous testicles.

1439
01:29:38,299 --> 01:29:41,568
- Wherever they may be.
- Wherever they may be.

1440
01:29:41,703 --> 01:29:44,272
All right, let's back up.
Let's go back a little bit.

1441
01:29:44,406 --> 01:29:46,540
- Let's clear some stuff up.
- He's super brave.

1442
01:29:46,674 --> 01:29:48,710
I've always been
the super clever one,

1443
01:29:48,843 --> 01:29:50,945
and he's always been
super brave.

1444
01:29:51,079 --> 01:29:53,214
- And super ball-less.
- Stop saying that!

1445
01:29:53,348 --> 01:29:55,717
- Both of my balls are right here!
- In spirit.

1446
01:29:55,850 --> 01:29:58,720
- Hey...
- They're here in spirit.

1447
01:29:59,921 --> 01:30:01,089
Always.

1448
01:30:02,157 --> 01:30:03,091
Of course.

1449
01:30:04,159 --> 01:30:05,126
Right, bro?

1450
01:30:10,398 --> 01:30:12,400
Right.

1451
01:30:12,534 --> 01:30:15,303
I got no balls.

1452
01:30:21,009 --> 01:30:23,111
There's the chest.

1453
01:30:23,244 --> 01:30:25,180
Okay. You're up, Grandpa.

1454
01:30:25,313 --> 01:30:27,949
- Who, me?
- Yes. You're the cat burglar.

1455
01:30:28,083 --> 01:30:30,318
- Huh?
- Your character, Ming.

1456
01:30:30,452 --> 01:30:32,153
- Ming?
- Yes, Ming.

1457
01:30:32,287 --> 01:30:33,688
Your avatar.
That's her name.

1458
01:30:33,822 --> 01:30:35,457
In your satchel,
you have lockpicks.

1459
01:30:35,589 --> 01:30:38,226
Lockpicks?
Why would I have lockpicks?

1460
01:30:38,359 --> 01:30:40,627
Because Ming's the cat burglar.

1461
01:30:40,762 --> 01:30:42,730
Don't you think one
of you should do this?

1462
01:30:42,864 --> 01:30:45,100
- You have the skills.
- I have the skills?

1463
01:30:45,233 --> 01:30:47,802
Not you. Ming.

1464
01:30:47,936 --> 01:30:49,871
Right. Ming.

1465
01:30:51,539 --> 01:30:53,607
Please don't ask who Ming is.

1466
01:31:03,952 --> 01:31:05,453
Not bad, huh?

1467
01:31:07,288 --> 01:31:10,291
Now we just gotta figure out
how to get you out of here.

1468
01:31:21,102 --> 01:31:22,337
Shall we?

1469
01:31:24,939 --> 01:31:26,474
Huh.

1470
01:31:26,608 --> 01:31:27,976
Now, that's cool.

1471
01:31:31,946 --> 01:31:35,617
Welcome. May I offer you
a piece of cake?

1472
01:31:36,684 --> 01:31:37,986
No! No!

1473
01:31:38,119 --> 01:31:39,621
No!

1474
01:31:43,424 --> 01:31:44,792
No, thank you.

1475
01:31:55,436 --> 01:31:56,738
Steady.

1476
01:32:10,118 --> 01:32:13,922
Ha! I'd like to see
your friend Ming do that!

1477
01:32:19,227 --> 01:32:21,029
We got an issue here.

1478
01:32:23,464 --> 01:32:25,233
Oh, thank you.

1479
01:32:28,002 --> 01:32:29,604
Thank you.

1480
01:32:37,745 --> 01:32:41,316
Brothers Kababik,
I present Jurgen the Brutal.

1481
01:32:51,226 --> 01:32:52,594
At last,

1482
01:32:52,727 --> 01:32:56,197
we meet on this historic day.

1483
01:32:56,331 --> 01:33:00,501
Yes, it is so great
to meet you.

1484
01:33:00,635 --> 01:33:04,038
Your Honor, if that be
the Falcon Jewel

1485
01:33:04,172 --> 01:33:08,209
upon your thick and meaty neck,

1486
01:33:08,343 --> 01:33:10,511
perhaps we should...

1487
01:33:10,645 --> 01:33:12,180
take it.

1488
01:33:12,313 --> 01:33:16,584
Today we forge
an unbreakable alliance.

1489
01:33:16,719 --> 01:33:19,187
Your family will join me,

1490
01:33:19,320 --> 01:33:23,958
and land by land,
we'll take the world.

1491
01:33:24,092 --> 01:33:27,462
So I ask, on this historic day,

1492
01:33:27,595 --> 01:33:29,130
where is she?

1493
01:33:30,699 --> 01:33:33,134
- Uh, where's who?
- Who you talking about?

1494
01:33:33,268 --> 01:33:35,069
Your sister.

1495
01:33:35,203 --> 01:33:36,871
Soon to be my bride.

1496
01:33:40,308 --> 01:33:45,179
You know what? I think that
there's been a misunderstanding.

1497
01:33:45,313 --> 01:33:47,115
Where is your sister?

1498
01:33:50,084 --> 01:33:52,520
Which sister were
we talking about?

1499
01:33:52,655 --> 01:33:56,424
Debbie or... Brooke?

1500
01:33:56,557 --> 01:33:58,493
Or Sierra?

1501
01:33:58,626 --> 01:34:02,297
Where is your sister?

1502
01:34:04,399 --> 01:34:06,801
She's getting ready,
back at the hotel.

1503
01:34:06,934 --> 01:34:09,304
She's doing what brides do
on their wedding day.

1504
01:34:09,437 --> 01:34:13,341
Hanging with the girls, getting
her hair done, mani-pedi.

1505
01:34:15,910 --> 01:34:18,714
If you come here
without your sister...

1506
01:34:21,482 --> 01:34:23,551
I just might have
to cut off your heads.

1507
01:34:23,686 --> 01:34:25,853
- Oh, no! No, no, no. Don't.
- Hey. Hey. Hey!

1508
01:34:25,987 --> 01:34:27,488
- God, no.
- Hey, get off!

1509
01:34:27,622 --> 01:34:31,159
- No. No.
- So I'll ask one last time:

1510
01:34:31,292 --> 01:34:34,495
- Getting a mani-pedi!
- Where is your sister?

1511
01:34:34,629 --> 01:34:36,397
I'm right here.

1512
01:34:44,472 --> 01:34:47,642
Gwendolyn Hortencia
Lewelda Kababik?

1513
01:34:47,776 --> 01:34:48,777
Is that you?

1514
01:34:48,910 --> 01:34:51,379
Um, yes.

1515
01:34:51,512 --> 01:34:52,647
That is me.

1516
01:34:53,915 --> 01:34:55,283
Now, please,

1517
01:34:55,416 --> 01:34:59,053
O Brutal One,
release my brothers.

1518
01:35:02,290 --> 01:35:04,559
And is it your
intention, on this day,

1519
01:35:04,693 --> 01:35:08,629
at this hour, to wed
Jurgen the Brutal of Zhatmire?

1520
01:35:10,298 --> 01:35:12,467
Yep. That's my plan.

1521
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:15,336
And is it your intention
to mother his children

1522
01:35:15,470 --> 01:35:18,473
and forge in blood
this union with your family?

1523
01:35:20,541 --> 01:35:21,576
Yes.

1524
01:35:21,710 --> 01:35:23,712
Gwendolyn Kababik...

1525
01:35:23,846 --> 01:35:25,714
known throughout the world

1526
01:35:25,848 --> 01:35:28,549
for your beauty and cunning.

1527
01:35:28,684 --> 01:35:32,186
And now you're mine.

1528
01:35:35,356 --> 01:35:39,762
Um... May I hold
the Falcon Jewel?

1529
01:35:41,229 --> 01:35:43,931
Of course, my bride.

1530
01:35:44,065 --> 01:35:45,734
Thank you.

1531
01:35:47,201 --> 01:35:48,136
Get it.

1532
01:35:51,272 --> 01:35:53,040
Jurgen the Brutal!

1533
01:35:53,174 --> 01:35:57,713
The Brothers Kababik
have been delayed in Gorek.

1534
01:35:57,846 --> 01:36:00,047
These are impostors!

1535
01:36:00,181 --> 01:36:01,884
- Impostors?
- Seize them!

1536
01:36:02,016 --> 01:36:03,819
No, no, no.
Oh, no. We can explain.

1537
01:36:03,951 --> 01:36:04,986
Oh, no, no, no.

1538
01:36:05,119 --> 01:36:07,088
I forgot to tell you one thing.

1539
01:36:09,257 --> 01:36:10,659
I have a boyfriend.

1540
01:36:22,937 --> 01:36:24,405
Get back.
Stay back.

1541
01:36:24,539 --> 01:36:26,340
- Stay away.
- Get back!

1542
01:36:26,474 --> 01:36:28,443
Get back!

1543
01:36:47,128 --> 01:36:50,965
- Get out of here!
- I will torch you, bitches.

1544
01:36:51,098 --> 01:36:53,167
I will literally
burn your face.

1545
01:37:15,289 --> 01:37:17,492
I'll meet the brothers
in Gorek.

1546
01:37:17,625 --> 01:37:18,660
Kill them all!

1547
01:37:21,162 --> 01:37:22,597
Go get him!

1548
01:37:22,731 --> 01:37:23,765
Go get the jewel!

1549
01:37:23,899 --> 01:37:25,968
Don't worry about us. Just go!

1550
01:37:28,135 --> 01:37:29,303
Backpack.

1551
01:37:32,106 --> 01:37:34,977
Get away! I know geometry.

1552
01:37:35,109 --> 01:37:38,212
I'm not messing around,
you guys. Get away!

1553
01:37:38,346 --> 01:37:40,381
Fridge, we're gonna die!

1554
01:37:51,526 --> 01:37:53,494
Anybody wanna dance
with the bride?

1555
01:38:59,828 --> 01:39:02,898
You want a piece?
Come on!

1556
01:39:08,870 --> 01:39:10,204
Nunchucks.

1557
01:39:22,516 --> 01:39:24,218
Awesome

1558
01:39:29,791 --> 01:39:31,158
We did it.

1559
01:39:31,292 --> 01:39:32,728
Let's go!

1560
01:39:42,070 --> 01:39:43,805
- Come on, come on!
- Hurry!

1561
01:39:56,985 --> 01:39:59,520
Whoa! Unh! Whoa!

1562
01:40:05,493 --> 01:40:07,029
Look!

1563
01:40:08,362 --> 01:40:10,032
- Is that Spencer?
- Oh, my God.

1564
01:41:00,716 --> 01:41:02,216
No!

1565
01:41:07,956 --> 01:41:08,857
Spencer!

1566
01:41:08,990 --> 01:41:10,324
- Oh!
- Oh!

1567
01:41:17,733 --> 01:41:20,035
Who are you?

1568
01:41:25,741 --> 01:41:27,843
I'm Dr. Smolder Bravestone.

1569
01:41:53,201 --> 01:41:55,536
Spencer!

1570
01:41:57,571 --> 01:41:59,941
- He says to get on his back.
- Who, me?

1571
01:42:32,674 --> 01:42:34,642
Oh, no. Milo!

1572
01:42:34,776 --> 01:42:36,044
- Oh, my God.
- What's he doing?

1573
01:42:36,178 --> 01:42:37,212
Wait.

1574
01:42:38,479 --> 01:42:40,015
Milo!

1575
01:42:48,857 --> 01:42:50,292
Yeah, Milo!

1576
01:42:51,927 --> 01:42:53,161
Go!

1577
01:42:55,831 --> 01:42:57,565
We're coming, Spencer!

1578
01:43:01,502 --> 01:43:03,337
"Show it to the sun."

1579
01:43:03,470 --> 01:43:04,773
Grandpa, the jewel!

1580
01:43:04,906 --> 01:43:07,943
You gotta show it
to the sun! Get ready!

1581
01:43:14,481 --> 01:43:16,718
Come on, Milo!

1582
01:43:16,852 --> 01:43:18,987
- Go!
- Come on, come on!

1583
01:43:33,301 --> 01:43:34,903
Yeah!

1584
01:43:45,313 --> 01:43:47,315
- Call out its name.
- Call out its name.

1585
01:43:47,448 --> 01:43:48,984
Call out its name!

1586
01:43:49,117 --> 01:43:51,820
Jumanji!

1587
01:43:51,953 --> 01:43:55,056
Jumanji!

1588
01:43:55,190 --> 01:43:56,157
What'd they say?

1589
01:43:58,459 --> 01:43:59,593
Jumanji?

1590
01:44:04,733 --> 01:44:05,934
Oh!

1591
01:44:28,522 --> 01:44:31,558
- Oh!
- Yes!

1592
01:44:31,693 --> 01:44:33,494
Ha, ha, we won!

1593
01:44:33,627 --> 01:44:35,297
- We did it!
- Hey.

1594
01:44:36,597 --> 01:44:38,667
Put me down.

1595
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:40,467
- Put me down, goddamn it. Stop!
- Okay.

1596
01:44:40,601 --> 01:44:43,271
Is this what you were
looking for? This little thing?

1597
01:44:43,405 --> 01:44:45,006
Grandpa, you guys
were incredible.

1598
01:44:45,140 --> 01:44:48,743
Yeah, that's the thing about
Milo. He's got a lot of skills.

1599
01:44:48,877 --> 01:44:50,145
Milo and Eddie.

1600
01:44:51,780 --> 01:44:53,114
Milo and Eddie.

1601
01:44:59,754 --> 01:45:02,190
Uh, what are we doing
here now?

1602
01:45:09,230 --> 01:45:10,732
Whoa!

1603
01:45:12,801 --> 01:45:14,669
Well done,
intrepid adventurers.

1604
01:45:14,803 --> 01:45:17,439
You have saved Jumanji.
Again.

1605
01:45:18,773 --> 01:45:20,241
And now,
with your permission,

1606
01:45:20,375 --> 01:45:23,278
Dr. Bravestone,
I will take the jewel from here.

1607
01:45:23,411 --> 01:45:26,147
I will protect it with my life
and return it to the care

1608
01:45:26,281 --> 01:45:28,615
of the elder
at the Avian Province.

1609
01:45:28,750 --> 01:45:30,919
And so your work here is done.

1610
01:45:31,052 --> 01:45:34,856
All of Jumanji thanks you. And,
sadly, this is where we part.

1611
01:45:34,990 --> 01:45:36,490
I don't know
what's sad about it.

1612
01:45:36,623 --> 01:45:38,525
I'm ready to get
the hell out of here.

1613
01:45:42,897 --> 01:45:43,932
What?

1614
01:45:45,767 --> 01:45:47,435
Really?

1615
01:45:49,636 --> 01:45:51,638
Hey, guys, you're not gonna
believe this.

1616
01:45:51,773 --> 01:45:54,275
What'd he say?

1617
01:45:54,409 --> 01:45:56,643
- He says that he...
- He wants to stay.

1618
01:45:58,579 --> 01:46:02,616
He says somebody's gotta stay
and look after this place.

1619
01:46:02,751 --> 01:46:05,720
And that he's 75 years old
and he just learned how to fly.

1620
01:46:09,024 --> 01:46:11,426
But he won't be able
to get out.

1621
01:46:12,794 --> 01:46:13,995
He knows.

1622
01:46:17,832 --> 01:46:19,667
Oh, Milo.

1623
01:46:23,071 --> 01:46:26,041
I feel like I, uh,
just got you back.

1624
01:46:26,174 --> 01:46:27,876
Now I'm losing you for good.

1625
01:46:30,245 --> 01:46:33,748
"You're not losing me, buddy.
I'll always be with you."

1626
01:46:40,255 --> 01:46:42,390
Being your partner...

1627
01:46:42,524 --> 01:46:46,127
is one of the best things
I ever got to be.

1628
01:46:48,696 --> 01:46:50,265
He says, "Thank you."

1629
01:46:50,398 --> 01:46:52,200
No, no.

1630
01:46:52,333 --> 01:46:54,235
Thank you, Milo.

1631
01:47:22,596 --> 01:47:24,299
Yes!

1632
01:47:24,432 --> 01:47:26,234
- Take care, Milo!
- Bye!

1633
01:47:26,367 --> 01:47:27,601
- Go, Milo!
- So long, Milo!

1634
01:47:27,735 --> 01:47:29,404
Bye-bye, Mr. Walker!

1635
01:47:32,740 --> 01:47:34,876
That's my partner right there.

1636
01:47:40,782 --> 01:47:44,085
Everybody should be so lucky
to have a friend like Milo.

1637
01:47:59,968 --> 01:48:02,770
Come on, Grandpa. Let's go home.

1638
01:48:07,308 --> 01:48:08,576
Hey, guys.

1639
01:48:11,045 --> 01:48:13,114
Thanks for coming to get me.

1640
01:48:18,086 --> 01:48:20,855
You do it again, your ass
is gonna be stuck here, Spencer!

1641
01:48:20,989 --> 01:48:22,323
'Cause I'm not coming back!

1642
01:48:45,380 --> 01:48:46,748
Everybody okay?

1643
01:48:48,349 --> 01:48:49,918
Yeah.

1644
01:48:50,051 --> 01:48:51,553
Grandpa,
you okay?

1645
01:48:53,188 --> 01:48:54,923
Yeah, I'm good.

1646
01:48:56,858 --> 01:48:58,927
Holy shit.

1647
01:49:12,675 --> 01:49:14,642
Strike. Square one.
Counterstrike.

1648
01:49:14,776 --> 01:49:16,244
The fat one on the bottom?

1649
01:49:16,377 --> 01:49:18,646
The fat...
No, the fat one above the R.

1650
01:49:18,780 --> 01:49:19,948
- Okay.
- Atop number two.

1651
01:49:20,081 --> 01:49:22,517
- Yeah. Yeah.
- So strike, strike.

1652
01:49:22,651 --> 01:49:24,719
- Yeah.
- Counterstrike.

1653
01:49:24,852 --> 01:49:27,522
Then kick me. O.

1654
01:49:31,726 --> 01:49:33,061
Let me tell you something.

1655
01:49:33,194 --> 01:49:36,397
- Getting old...
- I know. Getting old sucks.

1656
01:49:38,333 --> 01:49:39,734
Getting old...

1657
01:49:42,870 --> 01:49:44,272
...is a gift.

1658
01:49:46,709 --> 01:49:49,043
I forget that
sometimes.

1659
01:49:50,144 --> 01:49:51,579
But it is.

1660
01:49:55,883 --> 01:49:58,286
What more
could a guy possibly want?

1661
01:50:04,392 --> 01:50:06,294
Hey, guys.

1662
01:50:06,427 --> 01:50:08,296
How was your day?

1663
01:50:08,429 --> 01:50:10,798
It was really great.

1664
01:50:10,932 --> 01:50:12,600
Yeah.

1665
01:50:12,735 --> 01:50:15,704
Spencer taught me
how to play a video game.

1666
01:50:30,218 --> 01:50:31,586
Oh, hell, no.

1667
01:50:43,298 --> 01:50:44,866
You okay, Grandpa?

1668
01:50:47,670 --> 01:50:48,936
Yeah.

1669
01:50:49,070 --> 01:50:51,172
A lot of good memories here.

1670
01:51:02,785 --> 01:51:03,851
Eddie.

1671
01:51:03,985 --> 01:51:05,688
Eddie, is that you?

1672
01:51:05,820 --> 01:51:07,221
Nora.

1673
01:51:07,355 --> 01:51:09,123
- Hey.
- Oh, hi.

1674
01:51:09,257 --> 01:51:10,124
Hey, guys.

1675
01:51:10,258 --> 01:51:11,459
- Hi.
- Hi.

1676
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:14,362
What's up, bro?

1677
01:51:14,495 --> 01:51:17,065
So how's business?

1678
01:51:17,198 --> 01:51:18,667
Oh, you know how it is.

1679
01:51:18,801 --> 01:51:21,936
My manager quit six months
ago, moved to Philly.

1680
01:51:22,070 --> 01:51:24,639
Place has been kind of
a mess ever since.

1681
01:51:24,773 --> 01:51:28,309
It's hard to find people
who really know how to do this.

1682
01:51:28,443 --> 01:51:30,611
Oh, well...

1683
01:51:30,746 --> 01:51:32,681
I don't have to tell you this.

1684
01:51:32,815 --> 01:51:34,683
Mm.

1685
01:51:36,184 --> 01:51:37,952
So you need some help
around here?

1686
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:40,888
You mean it?

1687
01:51:41,022 --> 01:51:43,057
I mean, I...

1688
01:51:43,191 --> 01:51:44,625
I'd be honored.

1689
01:51:44,760 --> 01:51:46,160
Well...

1690
01:51:48,329 --> 01:51:50,164
It's really good
to see you, Eddie.

1691
01:51:51,432 --> 01:51:52,701
Likewise.

1692
01:51:57,372 --> 01:51:58,741
Um...

1693
01:52:02,977 --> 01:52:06,080
Um, I'm... I'm gonna take this

1694
01:52:06,214 --> 01:52:09,083
where I was going and...

1695
01:52:09,217 --> 01:52:11,352
I'll be right back.

1696
01:52:11,486 --> 01:52:13,921
You guys gotta come
to New York too.

1697
01:52:14,055 --> 01:52:16,491
Yeah, I can't wait.

1698
01:52:16,624 --> 01:52:19,160
This team, forever.

1699
01:52:19,293 --> 01:52:20,561
Forever.

1700
01:52:20,696 --> 01:52:22,463
Always.

1701
01:52:22,597 --> 01:52:25,099
Uh, always and forever?

1702
01:52:26,735 --> 01:52:29,604
- Yeah, let's keep close though.
- Of course, yeah.

1703
01:52:29,738 --> 01:52:31,239
One thing.

1704
01:52:31,372 --> 01:52:32,907
Can we all agree?

1705
01:52:33,040 --> 01:52:34,810
Let's never go back there.

1706
01:52:34,942 --> 01:52:36,911
- We already agreed on that.
- That's fine.

1707
01:53:17,618 --> 01:53:19,020
Sorry it's so late.

1708
01:53:19,153 --> 01:53:20,588
Yeah, it's that time of year.

1709
01:53:20,722 --> 01:53:23,090
- Everyone's heaters are broken.
- Oh, it's no problem.

1710
01:53:23,224 --> 01:53:24,760
I'm just glad you made it.

1711
01:53:24,893 --> 01:53:26,662
The furnace
is right over here.

1712
01:53:31,767 --> 01:53:34,168
Is that
an old video game console?

1713
01:53:34,302 --> 01:53:36,070
Hm?

1714
01:53:36,204 --> 01:53:38,139
Oh, yeah, probably.

1715
01:53:38,272 --> 01:53:40,475
It belongs to my son.

1716
01:53:40,608 --> 01:53:42,076
Hm.

1717
01:53:42,210 --> 01:53:44,680
Yeah, I'm a big gamer.

1718
01:53:44,813 --> 01:53:46,647
I've never seen
anything like it.

1719
01:53:51,820 --> 01:53:53,655
Well, it looks like
it's broken.

1720
01:53:55,056 --> 01:53:57,759
Maybe you shouldn't
touch it.

1721
01:54:18,613 --> 01:54:23,613
